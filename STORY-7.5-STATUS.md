# Story 7.5 Status
**Server-Side Receipt Validation & Entitlement Management**

## Status: üìù DRAFT

## Overview
Story 7.5 is currently in draft status. This story will deliver server-side receipt validation to securely verify subscriptions and prevent fraud, ensuring only paying customers access premium features.

## Key Deliverables (Planned)

### 1. CloudKit Function Implementation
- CloudKit Function: `validateSubscriptionReceipt` to be created
- JWS signature verification for transaction data
- Entitlement extraction from StoreKit 2 transactions

### 2. Entitlement Storage
- `SubscriptionEntitlement` record type in CloudKit
- Proper field definitions for subscription data
- Indexing for efficient queries

### 3. Entitlement Validation Logic
- Client-side querying with local caching
- Periodic server validation against Apple's servers
- Expiration checks for critical feature access

### 4. Fraud Prevention
- Duplicate transaction detection
- Receipt tampering detection
- Jailbreak detection and logging
- Anomalous usage pattern flagging

### 5. Grace Period & Billing Retry
- 16-day grace period for billing issues
- Entitlement maintenance during grace period
- Billing retry notifications to users
- Access revocation after grace period expiration

### 6. Offline Support
- Local entitlement caching
- 7-day offline grace period
- Background sync when connectivity returns

### 7. Admin Tools
- Subscription status dashboard
- Manual entitlement grant for support cases
- Refund/cancellation audit log

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Architecture Components
- CloudKit Function for server-side validation
- SubscriptionService package extensions
- SharedModels updates for entitlement data
- Repository pattern for data access

### Dependencies
- Story 7.4: Subscription Management & Status Monitoring
- CloudKit infrastructure from Epic 1
- StoreKit 2 integration from Story 7.1

## Validation Results (Planned)
- Unit tests for all validation logic
- Integration tests for CloudKit Function
- Security audit for fraud prevention measures
- Performance tests for validation operations

## Next Steps
1. Review story with development team
2. Finalize acceptance criteria
3. Begin implementation
4. Create unit and integration tests
5. Conduct code review
6. QA validation
7. Move to Done status
