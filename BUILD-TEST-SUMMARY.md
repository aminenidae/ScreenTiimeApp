# Build Test Summary Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the build testing performed on the ScreenTimeRewards project, with a focus on the RewardCore package implementation for Story 4.4: Notifications Progress Tracking.

## Test Results

### ✅ Test 1: Main iOS App Build
- **Command**: `xcodebuild -project ScreenTimeApp.xcodeproj -scheme ScreenTimeApp -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator build`
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: The main iOS application builds successfully without errors.

### ✅ Test 2: RewardCore Package Build
- **Command**: `swift build --target RewardCore`
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: The RewardCore package builds successfully without errors. This package contains the notification system implementation for Story 4.4.

### ⚠️ Test 3: SwiftLint
- **Command**: `swiftlint lint`
- **Result**: SKIPPED (SwiftLint not installed)
- **Details**: SwiftLint is not installed on the system. This doesn't affect functionality but would be useful for code quality checks.
