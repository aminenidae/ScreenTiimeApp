```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ScreenTimeRewards
```

### 2. Open in Xcode

```bash
open ScreenTimeRewards.xcworkspace
```

If workspace doesn't exist, open the Package.swift file:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

### 3. Configure Bundle Identifier

1. Open project settings in Xcode
2. Update bundle identifier from `com.yourcompany.screentimerewards` to your domain
3. Configure your development team
4. Update iCloud container identifiers in entitlements

### 4. Set Up CloudKit

1. Enable CloudKit in your Apple Developer Console
2. Create CloudKit container: `iCloud.{your-bundle-id}`
3. Update container identifier in `CloudKitService.swift`
4. Configure CloudKit schema (will be auto-generated)

### 5. Request Family Controls Entitlement

Family Controls requires special approval from Apple:

1. Go to Apple Developer Console
2. Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
3. Request Family Controls entitlement for your app
4. Provide justification for screen time access

### 6. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the project
âŒ˜+B

# Run on simulator (limited functionality)
âŒ˜+R

# For full testing, deploy to physical device via TestFlight
```

## Package Architecture

### SharedModels
Core data types shared across all packages:
- `ChildProfile` - Child user data
- `Reward` - Redeemable rewards
- `ScreenTimeSession` - App usage records
- `AppCategory` - Application categorization

### DesignSystem
Comprehensive UI toolkit:
- **Tokens** - Colors, typography, spacing
- **Components** - Buttons, cards, progress rings
- **Modifiers** - Consistent styling utilities
- **Gamification** - Points displays, achievement badges

### RewardCore
Business logic and algorithms:
- Point tracking engine implementation
- Point calculation engine with category-based point values
- Usage session processing and persistence
- Background tracking capability
- Edge case handling for app switching and device sleep/wake cycles
- Integration with DeviceActivityMonitor for accurate time tracking
- Data persistence with CloudKit synchronization
- Comprehensive unit testing suite

Key Components:
- **PointTrackingService**: Central coordinator for tracking time spent in educational apps
- **PointCalculationEngine**: Calculates points based on parent-defined values and app categories
- **UsageSessionRepository**: Manages persistence of usage session data
- **PointTransactionRepository**: Manages persistence of point transaction records

### CloudKitService
Data persistence layer:
- Protocol-based repositories
- CloudKit integration
- Offline synchronization
- Error handling

### FamilyControlsKit
Screen time monitoring:
- App usage tracking
- Time limit enforcement
- App categorization
- Device activity monitoring

## Development Workflow

### 1. Package Development
Each package is independently testable:

```bash
# Test specific package
cd Packages/DesignSystem
swift test

# Test all packages
swift test
```

### 2. Code Style
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Implement protocol-based architecture
- Write comprehensive unit tests

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - 70% coverage target
- **Integration Tests** - Package interaction
- **UI Tests** - Critical user flows
- **Manual Testing** - Screen time functionality

## Deployment

### TestFlight Deployment
Family Controls functionality requires physical device testing:

1. Archive the app in Xcode
2. Upload to App Store Connect
3. Create TestFlight build
4. Invite family members for testing
5. Test all screen time features

### App Store Submission
1. Complete App Store Connect metadata
2. Include privacy policy (required for Family Controls)
3. Provide detailed app review notes
4. Submit for review with entitlement justification

## Configuration Files

### Important Configuration
- `Info.plist` - App metadata and permissions
- `ScreenTimeRewards.entitlements` - Required entitlements
- `Package.swift` - Workspace dependencies
- `core-config.yaml` - BMad development configuration

### Bundle Identifiers
- Main App: `com.yourcompany.screentimerewards`
- Widget Extension: `com.yourcompany.screentimerewards.widget`
- App Intents: `com.yourcompany.screentimerewards.intents`

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- All data stored in family's private iCloud
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- COPPA compliant for children under 13
- Transparent data usage policies

### Permissions Required
- **Family Controls** - Screen time monitoring
- **iCloud** - Data synchronization
- **Background App Refresh** - Data updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Family Controls Authorization Fails**
- Ensure proper entitlement is configured
- Test on physical device, not simulator
- Verify Apple Developer Account has entitlement approval

**CloudKit Sync Issues**
- Check iCloud account status
- Verify container identifier matches
- Test with different iCloud accounts

**Build Failures**
- Clean build folder (âŒ˜+Shift+K)
- Reset package cache: `File > Packages > Reset Package Caches`
- Update to latest Xcode version

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging in development:

```swift
// In AppDelegate or App.swift
#if DEBUG
DesignSystem.Debug.enableDebugMode()
#endif
```
