# Story 5.3: Error Handling and Recovery Implementation - Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress for Story 5.3: Error Handling and Recovery Implementation.

## Story Details
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement error handling and recovery mechanisms,
**so that** the app remains stable even when unexpected issues occur.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. âœ… Graceful error handling is implemented for all critical functions
2. âœ… Data recovery mechanisms protect against data loss
3. âœ… User-friendly error messages guide users through issues
4. âœ… Logging helps diagnose and resolve problems

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Defined AppError enum with all possible error types
- [x] Created unit tests for AppError enum
- [x] Updated README to include error handling information
- [x] Implement error handling in all repository methods
- [x] Add error handling to all ViewModel classes
- [x] Implement data recovery mechanisms for critical operations
- [x] Add user-friendly error messages and guidance
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Create unit tests for error handling scenarios
- [x] Create integration tests for error recovery

### ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Review and refine error handling patterns
- [ ] Performance testing of error handling mechanisms
- [ ] Documentation of error handling strategies

### ðŸ”œ Planned Tasks
- [ ] Add integration tests for cross-service error propagation
- [ ] Consider more granular error recovery strategies

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Types
The AppError enum has been defined with comprehensive error types covering:
- Network and connectivity errors
- CloudKit errors
- Data validation errors
- Authentication errors
- Business logic errors
- System errors

### Testing
Unit tests have been created to validate all error types and their messages.
Integration tests have been created to validate error handling across package boundaries.

## Next Steps
1. Add integration tests for cross-service error propagation
2. Consider more granular error recovery strategies
3. Document error handling strategies
