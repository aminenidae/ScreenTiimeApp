# Story 2.2: Point Tracking Engine Implementation - Summary

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Point Tracking Engine for Story 2.2. The implementation includes all core functionality required for tracking time spent in educational apps and calculating points based on parent-defined values.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. RewardCore Package
- Created new Swift package for business logic
- Properly integrated with existing project structure
- Includes comprehensive unit tests

### 2. PointTrackingService
- Central coordinator for tracking time spent in educational apps
- Integrates with DeviceActivityMonitor patterns
- Handles background tracking and persistence
- Manages edge cases like app switching and device sleep/wake cycles

### 3. PointCalculationEngine
- Calculates points based on usage sessions
- Supports category-based point values (learning vs reward apps)
- Implements accurate time-based calculations
- Includes comprehensive unit tests

### 4. Repository Extensions
- Extended CloudKitService with UsageSessionRepository
- Extended CloudKitService with PointTransactionRepository
- Implemented data persistence with CloudKit synchronization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Follows established project patterns from previous stories
- Uses repository pattern for data persistence
- Implements proper error handling
- Maintains COPPA compliance requirements

### Platform Support
- iOS 15.0+ as required by DeviceActivityMonitor framework
- Proper availability annotations for cross-platform compatibility

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for core functionality
- Tests for point calculation accuracy
- Tests for edge cases and error conditions
- Mock implementations for dependency injection

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| AC | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| AC1 | System accurately tracks time spent in categorized educational apps | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC2 | Points are calculated and awarded based on parent-defined values | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC3 | Tracking works in the background and survives app restarts | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC4 | System handles edge cases like app switching and device sleep | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing** - Validate end-to-end functionality with DeviceActivityMonitor
2. **Physical Device Testing** - Test DeviceActivityMonitor functionality on actual devices
3. **Performance Testing** - Verify efficient tracking with minimal battery impact
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update relevant documentation with implementation details

## Build Status
✅ Building successfully with `swift build`

## Notes
The implementation follows all requirements specified in the story and maintains consistency with the established architectural patterns from previous stories. The code is well-tested and ready for integration testing with the actual DeviceActivityMonitor framework.
