# Reward-Based Screen Time Management App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Transform traditional screen time management from a restrictive model to a reward-based system
- Reduce family conflict around screen time by creating positive behavioral reinforcement
- Encourage educational app usage through tangible rewards
- Provide parents with customizable controls while maintaining ease of use
- Establish a foundation for a comprehensive family digital wellness platform
- Enable multiple parents to collaboratively manage their children's screen time profiles and settings **(v1.1)**

### Background Context

Current screen time management solutions, particularly Apple's built-in Screen Time feature, create adversarial relationships between parents and children by focusing purely on restrictions. Market research indicates that 73% of parents struggle with screen time management, and 68% report it as a source of family conflict. Our solution addresses this by reframing screen time from a punishment to an earned privilege, allowing children to earn points for time spent on educational apps which can then be converted into screen time for recreational apps or real-world rewards.

## Next Steps

### v1.0 MVP Development

**Timeline:** 12 weeks
**Focus:** Epic 1-5 (single-parent core functionality)

**UX Expert Prompt (v1.0):**
Create detailed UI/UX designs for the reward-based screen time management app based on the PRD. Focus on creating distinct but cohesive experiences for parents and children, with an emphasis on gamification elements that reinforce the reward system. Ensure COPPA compliance in all design elements. Prioritize the following screens: Parent Dashboard (single-parent), Child Dashboard, App Categorization Screen, Reward Conversion Screen, and Settings Screen. Note: Multi-parent UI features deferred to v1.1.

**Architect Prompt (v1.0):**
Design the technical architecture for the reward-based screen time management app based on the PRD. Focus on iOS Family Controls framework integration (iOS 15.0+), CloudKit data synchronization with zone-based architecture, and implementing the points-based reward system. Ensure COPPA compliance and prepare for App Store approval requirements. Address the following technical areas: iOS entitlements and Family Controls permissions, CloudKit schema and repository protocols, usage tracking via DeviceActivityMonitor, and security measures for children's data. Note: Prepare data models for multi-parent (v1.1) but implement single-parent functionality only.
