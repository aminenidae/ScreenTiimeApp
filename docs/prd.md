# Reward-Based Screen Time Management App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Transform traditional screen time management from a restrictive model to a reward-based system
- Reduce family conflict around screen time by creating positive behavioral reinforcement
- Encourage educational app usage through tangible rewards
- Provide parents with customizable controls while maintaining ease of use
- Establish a foundation for a comprehensive family digital wellness platform
- Enable multiple parents to collaboratively manage their children's screen time profiles and settings

### Background Context

Current screen time management solutions, particularly Apple's built-in Screen Time feature, create adversarial relationships between parents and children by focusing purely on restrictions. Market research indicates that 73% of parents struggle with screen time management, and 68% report it as a source of family conflict. Our solution addresses this by reframing screen time from a punishment to an earned privilege, allowing children to earn points for time spent on educational apps which can then be converted into screen time for recreational apps or real-world rewards.
