# Story 3.1: Parent Dashboard UI Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** parent,
**I want** a dashboard that shows all my children's progress,
**so that** I can monitor their educational app usage and reward accumulation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Parent dashboard displays all children's:
   - Current point balance
   - Today's usage summary (learning vs reward time)
   - Available rewards
   - Recent activity (last 5 sessions)
2. Visual progress indicators:
   - Progress rings for daily learning goals
   - Point accumulation charts (last 7 days)
   - Streak indicators (consecutive learning days)
3. Quick access buttons:
   - "Categorize Apps"
   - "Adjust Settings"
   - "View Detailed Reports"
4. Dashboard updates in real-time as children use apps:
   - CloudKit subscription for ChildProfile changes
   - UI updates via Combine publishers
5. Pull-to-refresh for manual sync
6. Empty state UI when no children added yet

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- `Family` - Represents a family unit with multiple parents and children
  - Fields: id, name, createdAt, ownerUserID, sharedWithUserIDs, childProfiles
- `ChildProfile` - Individual child account with point balance, app categorizations, and usage history
  - Fields: id, familyID, name, avatarAsset, birthDate, pointBalance, totalPointsEarned, deviceID, cloudKitZoneID
- `UsageSession` - Tracks time spent in an app during a continuous usage period
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, appCategorizationID, startTime, endTime, durationSeconds, pointsEarned, isValidated
- `PointTransaction` - Immutable ledger of all point earnings and redemptions
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, type, amount, relatedSessionID, relatedRedemptionID, description, timestamp, balanceAfter

### Parent Dashboard Architecture [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- ParentDashboardFeature as central UI component for family overview
- ParentDashboardViewModel for data loading and state management
- CloudKit subscriptions for real-time updates
- Repository pattern for data access
- Combine publishers for reactive UI updates

### File Locations and Naming
- Parent Dashboard View: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/ParentDashboard/Views/ParentDashboardView.swift`
- Parent Dashboard ViewModel: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/ParentDashboard/ViewModels/ParentDashboardViewModel.swift`
- Parent Dashboard Models: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/ParentDashboard/Models/`
- Unit tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/ParentDashboard/`
- Integration tests: `Tests/IntegrationTests/ParentDashboardTests/`

### Technical Constraints [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (Family Controls framework dependency)
- **Device Requirement:** Physical device required for Family Controls testing
- **Framework Dependency:** Native Family Controls framework only
- **Privacy Compliance:** COPPA regulations must be maintained
- **Performance:** Efficient UI with minimal battery impact

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- Family Controls requires proper parent authorization
- Secure storage of family data in CloudKit shared zones
- Respect privacy boundaries for child usage data
- Proper error handling for authorization failures

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- Unit tests in `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/ParentDashboard/` directory
- Integration tests in `Tests/IntegrationTests/ParentDashboardTests/` directory

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names
- **Coverage:** All public interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test Parent Dashboard View with various numbers of child profiles
- Verify real-time updates with CloudKit subscriptions
- Validate data loading and error handling
- Test pull-to-refresh functionality
- Verify navigation to other screens
- Test empty state handling
- Physical device testing for Family Controls functionality
- Performance testing for UI responsiveness

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified implementation follows architecture guidelines
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Add performance benchmarks for dashboard with 10+ children
- [x] Implement performance tests with varying numbers of children
- [x] Consider pagination or virtualization for very large families

### Security Review

The implementation follows proper security practices for CloudKit integration:
- Uses CloudKit shared zones for family data isolation
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in code
- Leverages native iOS security features
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

### Performance Considerations

The implementation now includes comprehensive performance optimizations and monitoring:
- Uses LazyVStack for child progress cards (good)
- Implements concurrent loading for progress data (good)
