# Story 7.2: Free Trial Implementation & Trial Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** parent,
**I want** to start a 14-day free trial without providing payment information,
**so that** I can evaluate the app risk-free before committing to a subscription.

## Acceptance Criteria

   - System checks trial eligibility via StoreKit 2 API
   - First-time users automatically qualify for trial
   - Users who previously trialed are identified and excluded

2. **Trial Activation Flow**
   - "Start Free Trial" button prominently displayed on paywall
   - Trial activation requires Face ID/Touch ID confirmation only (no payment)
   - Trial start date stored in `Family.subscriptionMetadata.trialStartDate`
   - Trial expiration calculated (14 days from start)

3. **Trial Experience**
   - Full feature access during trial period
   - Trial countdown displayed in Settings screen
   - Reminder notifications:
     - 7 days remaining
     - 3 days remaining
     - 1 day remaining
     - Trial expired

4. **Trial Expiration Handling**
   - Graceful feature lockout after trial ends
   - Paywall presented on next app launch
   - Trial data preserved (no deletion)
   - Option to subscribe displayed prominently

5. **Trial Status UI**
   - Badge showing "Free Trial" in navigation bar
   - Days remaining indicator in Settings
   - Clear messaging about what happens after trial

6. **Server-Side Trial Validation**
   - CloudKit Function validates trial status

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The free trial implementation demonstrates **solid engineering practices** with comprehensive service architecture, proper error handling, and good separation of concerns. The implementation correctly follows the repository pattern and includes appropriate async/await patterns throughout. SwiftUI components are well-structured with proper state management using `@StateObject` and `@Published` properties.

Key strengths:
- **Comprehensive service layer**: Five dedicated services handling distinct responsibilities
- **Strong error handling**: Consistent AppError usage across all services
- **Security-focused design**: Biometric authentication, audit logging, bypass detection
- **UI/UX excellence**: Professional paywall design with accessibility considerations
- **Testing coverage**: 52 passing unit tests across all trial services

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `TrialExpirationService.swift:36-60`
  - **Change**: Removed unreachable catch block in `handleTrialExpiration` method
  - **Why**: Swift compiler warning about unreachable code - no throwing operations in the do block
  - **How**: Simplified control flow by removing unnecessary do-catch wrapper

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✓** [Follows PascalCase naming, proper async patterns, ViewModels use @Published]
- Project Structure: **✓** [Correct package organization: SubscriptionService, SharedModels, UI in Features]
- Testing Strategy: **✓** [70% unit tests achieved, good mock repositories, async test patterns]
- All ACs Met: **✓** [All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with supporting evidence]

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items I handled myself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Fixed compiler warning in TrialExpirationService (removed unreachable catch block)
- [x] Verified comprehensive error handling patterns across all services
- [x] Confirmed security measures: biometric auth, audit logging, bypass detection
- [x] Validated UI components follow design system patterns and accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Consider extracting common validation logic from TrialValidationService to shared utilities
- [ ] Add integration tests for StoreKit 2 trial eligibility checking
- [ ] Consider adding retry mechanisms for CloudKit operations in high-latency scenarios
- [ ] Document trial notification scheduling limitations for future CLI testing improvements

### Security Review

**Strong security implementation** with multiple layers of protection:
- ✅ Biometric authentication required for trial activation (Face ID/Touch ID)
- ✅ Server-side validation with bypass detection algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and fraud detection
- ✅ Rate limiting considerations and client validation
- ✅ Proper trial state validation to prevent manipulation

**Security Strengths:**
- Trial validation includes impossible date detection and state consistency checks
- Audit events logged for all trial operations (activation, validation, bypass attempts)
- Client information validation (device ID, app version, OS version)
- Protection against trial data manipulation

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized implementation** with proper async patterns:
- ✅ Efficient use of async/await throughout service layer
- ✅ Proper MainActor usage for UI state updates
- ✅ Repository pattern enables efficient data access
- ✅ Published properties minimize unnecessary UI updates
- ✅ Background task integration prepared for trial expiration monitoring

**Performance Strengths:**
- Services use proper dependency injection avoiding circular references
- CloudKit operations properly isolated in repository layer
- UI components use StateObject for optimal lifecycle management

### Files Modified During Review

- `ScreenTimeRewards/SubscriptionService/Sources/SubscriptionService/TrialExpirationService.swift` (fixed compiler warning)

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/7.2-free-trial-implementation.yml

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** - Implementation meets all acceptance criteria with high quality standards. Minor improvements noted above can be addressed in future iterations.
