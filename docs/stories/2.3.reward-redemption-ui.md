### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- `RewardRedemption` - Records when a child converts points to screen time for reward apps
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, appCategorizationID, pointsSpent, timeGrantedMinutes, conversionRate, redeemedAt, expiresAt, timeUsedMinutes, status
- `PointTransaction` - Immutable ledger of all point earnings and redemptions (already implemented in Story 2.2)
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, type, amount, relatedSessionID, relatedRedemptionID, description, timestamp, balanceAfter

### Reward Redemption Architecture [Source: architecture/components.md]
- ChildDashboardFeature as central UI component for points display
- RewardRedemptionFeature for reward app selection and conversion
- PointRedemptionService for conversion logic
- FamilyControlsService extension for reward time allocation
- Repository pattern for data persistence

### File Locations and Naming
- Child Dashboard View: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/ChildDashboard/Views/ChildDashboardView.swift`
- Reward Redemption View: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/RewardRedemption/Views/RewardRedemptionView.swift`
- Point Redemption Service: `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/PointRedemptionService.swift`
- Extended Family Controls Service: `Packages/FamilyControlsKit/Sources/FamilyControlsKit/FamilyControlsService.swift`
- Extended Repository: `Packages/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/RewardRedemptionRepository.swift`
- Data Models: `Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/Models.swift`
- Unit tests: `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/RewardRedemptionTests.swift`
- Integration tests: `Tests/IntegrationTests/RewardRedemptionTests/`

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (Family Controls framework dependency)
- **Device Requirement:** Physical device required for Family Controls testing
- **Framework Dependency:** Native Family Controls framework only
- **Privacy Compliance:** COPPA regulations must be maintained
- **Performance:** Efficient UI with minimal battery impact

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- Family Controls requires proper parent authorization
- Secure storage of redemption data in CloudKit
- Respect privacy boundaries for child usage data
- Proper error handling for authorization failures

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests in `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/RewardRedemptionTests/` directory
- Integration tests in `Tests/IntegrationTests/RewardRedemptionTests/` directory

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names (e.g., `testPointRedemption_100PointsAt10PerMinute_Returns10Minutes`)
- **Coverage:** All public RewardCore reward redemption interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test Point Redemption Service with various point balances and conversion rates
- Verify Reward Redemption View with different app selections
- Validate data persistence with CloudKit integration
- Test edge cases: insufficient points, time limits, app availability
- Physical device testing for Family Controls functionality
- Performance testing for UI responsiveness
