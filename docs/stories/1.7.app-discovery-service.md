# Story 1.7: App Discovery and Metadata Services Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement app discovery and metadata services foundation,
**so that** Epic 2 can immediately begin with app categorization functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **App Discovery Service created** in FamilyControlsKit package
   - Integrates with `ManagedSettingsStore.application` to access installed apps
   - Uses `FamilyActivityPicker` for app selection (iOS 15.0+ native approach)
   - Handles app bundle identifier resolution
2. **App Metadata Service implemented**
   - Fetches app display names, icons, and bundle identifiers
   - Caches app icons locally for performance (using NSCache)
   - Handles system apps vs user-installed apps distinction
3. **Installed Apps Repository protocol created**
   - Protocol: `InstalledAppsRepository` in CloudKitService package
   - Follows established patterns from Story 1.3
   - Mock implementation for testing
4. **Integration validation**
   - Works with CloudKit zone-based architecture
   - Physical device testing completed
   - Handles edge cases: deleted apps, system apps, restricted apps
