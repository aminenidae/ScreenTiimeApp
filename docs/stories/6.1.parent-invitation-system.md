# Story 6.1: Parent Invitation System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a parent (family owner)**,
**I want to invite another parent to co-manage our family account**,
**so that we can both access and manage our children's screen time settings.**

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Invite Flow UI Created**
   - New "Family Sharing" section added to Settings screen
   - "Invite Co-Parent" button prominently displayed
   - Current co-parents list shown with avatars and roles
   - "Remove Co-Parent" option available (owner only)

2. **Secure Invitation Link Generation**
   - System generates unique, time-limited invitation token (UUID)
   - Invitation stored in CloudKit record type `FamilyInvitation`
   - Deep link generated: `screentimerewards://invite/{token}`
   - Share sheet allows sending via Messages, Email, or AirDrop

3. **Invitation Acceptance Flow**
   - Invitee taps deep link â†’ App opens
   - Invitation validation (token validity, expiration, iCloud account)
   - Acceptance screen displays inviting parent, family details
   - On acceptance: Add to `Family.sharedWithUserIDs`, grant CloudKit access

4. **CloudKit Sharing Integration**
   - `CKShare` record shares Family record with invitee
   - Read/write access granted to shared zone
   - Child zone access configured
   - CloudKit subscriptions created

5. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages for expired/invalid invitations
   - Network error handling with retry logic

6. **Security & Validation**
   - 72-hour token expiration
   - One-time use enforcement
   - Owner-only invitation privileges (v1.1)
   - Maximum 2 parents per family (v1.1)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 7.7 completion: The subscription analytics framework is now complete with comprehensive event logging and CloudKit integration patterns that can be leveraged for invitation tracking and family management events.

### Data Models
**Family Model Extensions Required** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Family]:
- `sharedWithUserIDs: [String]` - iCloud user IDs of additional parents
- CloudKit shared zone metadata for multi-parent access
- Conflict resolution fields for concurrent edits

**New FamilyInvitation Model Required**:
```swift
struct FamilyInvitation {
    let id: UUID
    let familyID: UUID
    let invitingUserID: String
    let inviteeEmail: String?
    let token: UUID
    let createdAt: Date
    let expiresAt: Date
    let isUsed: Bool
    let deepLinkURL: String
}
```

### CloudKit Sharing Architecture
**CloudKit CKShare Integration** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use `CKShare` records to share Family records with invited parents
- Configure shared CloudKit zones for multi-parent access
- Implement CloudKit subscriptions for real-time synchronization
- Use CloudKit conflict resolution for concurrent family edits

### UI Components & Patterns
**Settings Screen Extensions** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- Extend existing Settings feature with new "Family Sharing" section
- Use standard SwiftUI navigation and form patterns
- Implement Share Sheet integration for invitation sending
- Follow DesignSystem patterns for buttons, lists, and error states

### File Locations
**Based on Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Models: `ScreenTimeRewards/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/`
- CloudKit Service: `ScreenTimeRewards/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/`
- Settings UI: `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Settings/`
- Deep Link Handling: `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/App/`

### Technical Constraints
**CloudKit Sharing Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#CloudKit]:
- Use CKShare for record-level sharing
- Configure CloudKit subscriptions for real-time updates
- Implement proper error handling for sharing permissions
- Follow CloudKit best practices for shared zones

**iOS Deep Linking** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Register custom URL scheme in Info.plist
- Handle URL routing in SceneDelegate or App struct
- Validate deep link parameters before processing

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Focus on invitation token generation, validation logic, and CloudKit sharing setup
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Test CloudKit sharing flow, deep link handling, and Family model updates
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Test complete invitation flow from creation to acceptance

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Settings/`
- CloudKit tests: `ScreenTimeRewards/CloudKitService/Tests/CloudKitServiceTests/`
- Integration tests: `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Integration/`

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test invitation token expiration and validation
- Test CloudKit sharing permissions and access control
- Test deep link URL parsing and validation
- Test error scenarios (expired tokens, network failures, permission issues)
- Mock CloudKit operations for unit testing
- Test family sharing limits and owner-only restrictions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the Parent Invitation System is well-structured and follows good architectural patterns. The code is organized into clear layers:
- View layer with SwiftUI components for the UI
- ViewModel layer for state management
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access

The implementation correctly uses dependency injection, follows Swift concurrency patterns with async/await, and maintains good separation of concerns. Error handling is comprehensive with appropriate user feedback mechanisms.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the code quality is already high.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ“ All code follows the defined coding standards with proper type sharing in SharedModels, CloudKit access through repository protocols, and proper state management with ViewModels owning @Published state.
- Project Structure: âœ“ Code is organized according to the unified project structure with appropriate separation of features, packages, and tests.
- Testing Strategy: âœ“ Implementation follows the testing pyramid with unit tests (70%), integration tests (20%), and UI tests (10%).
- All ACs Met: âœ“ All acceptance criteria have been implemented and validated through tests.
