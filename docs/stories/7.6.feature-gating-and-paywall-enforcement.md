# Story 7.6: Feature Gating & Paywall Enforcement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As the** system,
**I need** to enforce subscription-based feature access,
**so that** free users are guided to subscribe and paid users receive full access.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Feature Gate Service**
   - `FeatureGateService` singleton created
   - Checks subscription status before feature access
   - Returns `FeatureAccessResult` (allowed/denied/trial)

2. **Feature Access Rules**
   - Trial users: Full access to all features
   - 1 Child Plan: 1 child profile, all features
   - 2+ Child Plans: Multiple children, all features
   - Expired subscription: Read-only access, paywall prompts

3. **Gated Features**
   - Child profile creation (based on tier)
   - Advanced analytics (premium only after trial)
   - Export reports (premium only)
   - Multi-parent invitations (v1.1, premium only)

4. **Paywall Trigger Points**
   - Add child beyond limit → Upgrade paywall
   - Access premium analytics → Subscribe paywall
   - Trial expiration → Conversion paywall
   - Lapsed subscription → Re-subscribe paywall

5. **UI Feature Gating**
   - Premium features show "lock" badge when unavailable
   - Tap on locked feature opens paywall
   - Upgrade prompts display pricing and value prop

6. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Expired users retain read-only access to existing data
   - No data deletion on subscription lapse
   - Core app categorization remains functional (view-only)

7. **Messaging & CTAs**
   - Clear upgrade benefits messaging
   - "Unlock with Premium" buttons
   - Trial countdown creates urgency

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 7.5 completion, key technical foundations are in place:
- `EntitlementValidationService` for subscription status checking
- `SubscriptionEntitlement` model with tier and trial status
- `FraudPreventionService` for anomalous usage detection
- `GracePeriodService` for offline subscription handling
- `OfflineEntitlementService` for 7-day grace period support

### Data Models
**SubscriptionEntitlement Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#subscriptionentitlement]:
- `subscriptionTier`: SubscriptionTier - Enum: `.oneChild`, `.twoChildren`, `.threeOrMore`
- `isActive`: Bool - Current subscription status
- `isInTrial`: Bool - Whether in 14-day free trial
- `expirationDate`: Date - When subscription expires
- `gracePeriodExpiresAt`: Date? - Offline grace period

**Family Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#family]:
- `childProfiles`: [UUID] - Array of child profile IDs for count validation
- `subscriptionStatus` field synced with entitlement status

**ChildProfile Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#childprofile]:
- Count validation required for subscription tier enforcement
- Existing profiles must remain accessible in read-only mode

### API Specifications
**EntitlementValidationService Interface** [Source: architecture/components.md#subscriptionservice]:
- `checkEntitlement() async -> SubscriptionEntitlement?` - Returns current subscription status
- `isFeatureAccessible(_ feature: Feature) async -> FeatureAccessResult` - Feature-specific access checking
- Combine publishers for reactive entitlement updates
- Offline grace period handling built-in

### Component Specifications
**FeatureGateService Requirements** [Source: architecture/components.md#subscriptionservice]:
- Singleton pattern for app-wide access control
- Integration with existing SubscriptionService package
- Async/await patterns for subscription status checking
- Caching mechanism to avoid repeated subscription checks
- Reactive updates when subscription status changes

**UI Gating Components** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]:
- SwiftUI native components with view modifiers
- Consistent lock badge design using SF Symbols
- Navigation integration for paywall presentation
- Accessibility support for premium feature indicators

### File Locations
**Subscription Feature Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Service logic: `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/SubscriptionService/Sources/SubscriptionService/`
- UI components: `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/Features/*/` (distributed across feature folders)
- Shared models: `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/`
- Design system: `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/DesignSystem/Sources/DesignSystem/`
- Tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Subscription/`

### Technical Constraints
**Feature Gate Performance** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]:
- Local caching of subscription status to prevent UI blocking
- Async checking with immediate UI feedback
- Offline-first approach with graceful degradation
- Memory-efficient singleton implementation

**UI Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]:
- SwiftUI view modifiers for feature gating
- Combine integration for reactive subscription updates
- Navigation coordination for paywall presentation
- Consistent visual language across all gated features

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests (70%): Focus on feature access logic, subscription tier validation
- Integration tests (20%): Cross-service communication with EntitlementValidationService
- UI tests (10%): Paywall presentation flows, gated feature interactions
- Test file location: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Subscription/`
- Mock subscription states for comprehensive testing scenarios

### Security Review

This story involves critical security functionality as it controls access to premium features based on subscription status. All testing has been completed which ensures:
1. Premium features are properly accessible only to subscribers
2. Free users are correctly blocked from features they shouldn't have access to
3. Revenue protection through proper paywall enforcement

### Performance Considerations

The story correctly identifies the need for local caching of subscription status to prevent UI blocking. This is important for maintaining a responsive user experience.
