# Story 7.4: Subscription Management & Status Monitoring

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** parent,
**I want** to view and manage my subscription,
**so that** I can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel as my family's needs change.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Subscription Status Service**
   - Real-time subscription status monitoring via `Transaction.currentEntitlements`
   - Status synced to CloudKit `Family.subscriptionStatus` field
   - Subscription states handled:
     - `active` - Paid and current
     - `trial` - In free trial period
     - `expired` - Lapsed subscription
     - `gracePeriod` - Payment issue, retrying
     - `revoked` - Refunded or cancelled

2. **Subscription Details Screen**
   - Current plan displayed (e.g., "2 Child Plan - Monthly")
   - Next billing date shown
   - Subscription price displayed
   - Manage subscription button (links to App Store)
   - Cancel subscription option

3. **Plan Upgrade/Downgrade**
   - "Change Plan" button in Settings
   - Upgrade flow to add more children
   - Downgrade flow with data preservation warning
   - Prorated billing handled by Apple
   - Immediate entitlement changes applied

4. **Subscription Renewal Monitoring**
   - Auto-renewal status detected
   - Renewal success/failure notifications
   - Billing issue alerts with resolution steps
   - Grace period handling (continue access for 16 days)

5. **Cancellation Flow**
   - "Cancel Subscription" redirects to App Store settings
   - Cancellation confirmation detected
   - Access continues until period end
   - Re-subscription offer presented after cancellation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 7.3 completion, key technical foundations are in place:
- SubscriptionService package established with StoreKit 2 integration
- SubscriptionViewModel pattern established for state management
- ProductIdentifiers.swift contains subscription product definitions
- Analytics integration pattern established for tracking subscription events
- Error handling patterns with PurchaseErrorView component established

### Data Models
**SubscriptionEntitlement Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#subscriptionentitlement]:
- `subscriptionTier`: SubscriptionTier enum (.oneChild, .twoChildren, .threeOrMore)
- `isActive`: Bool for current subscription status
- `isInTrial`: Bool for 14-day free trial state
- `autoRenewStatus`: Bool for auto-renewal enabled status
- `expirationDate`: Date when subscription expires
- `gracePeriodExpiresAt`: Date? for offline grace period handling

**Family Model Updates** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#family]:
- `subscriptionStatus` field needs to be synced with real-time StoreKit status
- CloudKit shared zone architecture for multi-parent visibility

### API Specifications
**StoreKit 2 Transaction Monitoring** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#in-app-purchases]:
- Use `Transaction.currentEntitlements` for real-time subscription status
- Modern async/await API pattern established in previous stories
- Automatic retry logic and analytics tracking pattern established

**CloudKit Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]:
- Family.subscriptionStatus field synchronization required
- CloudKit conflict resolution using CKRecord system fields

### Component Specifications
**SubscriptionDetailsView Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]:
- Follow SwiftUI declarative UI patterns established in project
- Use DesignSystem package tokens for consistent styling
- Integrate with existing SubscriptionViewModel for state management
- Follow navigation patterns established in Settings screen

### File Locations
**Subscription Feature Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Main views: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Subscription/Views/`
- ViewModels: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Subscription/ViewModels/`
- Service logic: `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/SubscriptionService/Sources/SubscriptionService/`
- Shared models: `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/`
- Tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Subscription/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests (70%): Focus on SubscriptionStatusService logic, state management
- Integration tests (20%): StoreKit 2 integration, CloudKit sync functionality
- UI tests (10%): End-to-end subscription management flows
- Test file location: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Subscription/`
- Follow XCTest framework patterns with SwiftUI testing utilities

### Technical Constraints
**StoreKit 2 Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#in-app-purchases]:
- iOS 15.0+ minimum deployment target
- Async/await API usage for modern concurrency
- Transaction verification and fraud prevention
- Offline grace period support (16 days per acceptance criteria)

**CloudKit Synchronization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]:
- Real-time sync using CloudKit publishers with Combine
- Conflict resolution using CKRecord metadata and vector clocks
- Multi-parent collaborative access via shared zones

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation for subscription management and status monitoring is well-structured and follows good architectural patterns. The code is organized into distinct components:
- SubscriptionStatusService for real-time monitoring
- SubscriptionCloudKitSync for data synchronization
- SubscriptionRenewalMonitor for renewal tracking
- SubscriptionCancellationDetector for cancellation handling
- SubscriptionDetailsView for UI presentation

The implementation correctly uses StoreKit 2 with async/await patterns and properly handles all required subscription states (active, trial, expired, gracePeriod, revoked). The code also includes proper error handling, analytics tracking, and notification management.
