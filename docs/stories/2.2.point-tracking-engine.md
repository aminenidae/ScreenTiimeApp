### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- `UsageSession` - Tracks time spent in apps
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, appBundleID, startTime, endTime, duration
- `PointTransaction` - Immutable ledger of point earnings
  - Fields: id, childProfileID, appBundleID, pointsAwarded, timestamp, sessionID

### Point Tracking Architecture [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- PointTrackingService as central tracking coordinator
- DeviceActivityMonitor for real-time usage events
- PointCalculationEngine for point computation
- Repository pattern for data persistence
- Combine publishers for reactive data streams

### File Locations and Naming
- Point Tracking Service: `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/PointTrackingService.swift`
- Point Calculation Engine: `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/PointCalculationEngine.swift`
- Extended Repositories: `Packages/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/UsageSessionRepository.swift`, `Packages/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/PointTransactionRepository.swift`
- Data Models: `Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/Models.swift`
- Unit tests: `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/PointTrackingTests.swift`
- Integration tests: `Tests/IntegrationTests/PointTrackingTests/`

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (DeviceActivityMonitor framework dependency)
- **Device Requirement:** Physical device required for DeviceActivityMonitor testing
- **Framework Dependency:** Native DeviceActivityMonitor framework only
- **Privacy Compliance:** COPPA regulations must be maintained
- **Performance:** Efficient tracking with minimal battery impact

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- DeviceActivityMonitor requires user consent through Family Controls
- Proper error handling for authorization failures
- Secure storage of tracking data in CloudKit
- Respect privacy boundaries for app usage data

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests in `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/PointTrackingTests/` directory
- Integration tests in `Tests/IntegrationTests/PointTrackingTests/` directory

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names (e.g., `testPointCalculation_30MinutesAt20PerHour_Returns10Points`)
- **Coverage:** All public RewardCore point tracking interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test Point Tracking Service with mock DeviceActivityMonitor
- Verify Point Calculation Engine with various time intervals and point values
- Validate data persistence with CloudKit integration
- Test edge cases: app switching, device sleep, backgrounding
- Physical device testing for DeviceActivityMonitor functionality
- Performance testing for battery impact
