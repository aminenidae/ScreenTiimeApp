## Dev Notes

### Dependencies and Integration Points

**Previous Stories Required:**
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (CloudKit, auth, data models)
- Epic 2: Core Reward System (point tracking, usage monitoring)
- Story 1.2: Family Controls integration (DeviceActivityMonitor)
- Story 2.2: Point tracking engine implementation

### Architecture Context
This story implements sophisticated usage validation algorithms to prevent children from gaming the reward system. The validation service integrates with the existing `DeviceActivityMonitor` and point tracking infrastructure established in Epic 1 and 2.

### Data Model Dependencies
**Primary Data Sources** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**UsageSession Model Extensions:**
- Current fields: `startTime`, `endTime`, `durationSeconds`, `pointsEarned`, `childProfileID`, `appCategorizationID`
- Additional fields needed: `isValidated: Bool`, `validationDetails: ValidationDetails?`
- Validation metadata structure required for audit trails

**FamilySettings Integration:**
- `validationStrictness: ValidationLevel` - Controls algorithm sensitivity
- Enum values: `.lenient`, `.moderate`, `.strict` [Source: architecture/data-models.md#FamilySettings]

**New Data Models Required:**

```swift
struct ValidationDetails {
    let validationScore: Double        // 0.0 (suspicious) to 1.0 (genuine)
    let confidenceLevel: Double        // Algorithm confidence in assessment
    let detectedPatterns: [GamingPattern]
    let engagementIndicators: EngagementMetrics
    let validatedAt: Date
    let validationAlgorithmVersion: String
}

enum GamingPattern {
    case rapidAppSwitching(frequency: Double)
    case suspiciouslyLongSession(duration: TimeInterval)
    case exactHourBoundaries
    case deviceLockDuringSession
    case backgroundUsage
}

struct EngagementMetrics {
    let appStateChanges: Int
    let averageSessionLength: TimeInterval
    let interactionDensity: Double
    let deviceMotionCorrelation: Double?
}
```

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Service Architecture** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Package Location:** `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/`
- **Service Class:** `UsageValidationService` implementing validation protocols
- **Repository Integration:** Use existing `UsageSessionRepository` protocol patterns
- **CloudKit Integration:** Store validation metadata in UsageSession records

**Validation Algorithm Framework:**
```swift
protocol UsageValidator {
    func validateSession(_ session: UsageSession) async -> ValidationResult
    var validatorName: String { get }
    var minimumConfidenceThreshold: Double { get }
}

class CompositeUsageValidator: UsageValidator {
    private let validators: [UsageValidator]
    // Combines multiple validation algorithms with weighted scoring
}
```

**DeviceActivityMonitor Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework:** DeviceActivityMonitor from Family Controls framework
- **Usage:** Real-time app state monitoring and interaction tracking
- **Data Sources:** App launch events, device lock/unlock events, background transitions

### Validation Algorithm Details

**1. Rapid App Switching Detection:**
- Track app launch sequences within short time windows (< 30 seconds)
- Flag sessions with > 5 app switches per minute as suspicious
- Consider legitimate multitasking patterns (e.g., switching between reference apps)

**2. Passive Usage Detection:**
- Monitor device interaction patterns during learning sessions
- Flag sessions with no device motion/touch for > 10 minutes consecutively
- Correlate with app state changes and background activity

**3. Suspicious Timing Patterns:**
- Detect sessions starting/ending exactly on hour boundaries
- Flag unnaturally regular usage patterns
- Consider timezone changes and legitimate scheduling

**4. Device Context Validation:**
- Track device lock/unlock events during sessions
- Validate that sessions align with actual device usage
- Handle edge cases like background app refresh and notifications

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Point Calculation Integration:**
- Modify `PointCalculationService` to apply validation multipliers
- Validated sessions: 100% points, Suspicious sessions: 50% points, Invalid sessions: 0% points
- Store original and adjusted point values for transparency

**Parent Notification Integration:**
- Send notifications for sessions flagged as suspicious
- Provide detailed validation reports in parent dashboard
- Allow parents to override validation decisions for false positives

**CloudKit Schema Updates:**
- Add validation fields to `UsageSession` record type
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data
- Implement migration strategy for existing sessions

### Validation Strictness Levels

**Lenient Mode:**
- Only flag obviously suspicious behavior
- High threshold for false positives
- 90% confidence required for session rejection

**Moderate Mode (Default):**
- Balanced approach with reasonable thresholds
- 75% confidence required for session rejection
- Notify parents of questionable sessions

**Strict Mode:**
- Aggressive validation with low tolerance
- 60% confidence required for session rejection
- Detailed logging for all borderline cases

### Performance Considerations

**Algorithm Efficiency:**
- Validation algorithms must complete within 2 seconds per session
- Use background processing for historical session analysis
- Cache validation results to avoid redundant calculations
- Optimize CloudKit queries for validation metadata

**Resource Management:**
- Limit validation processing to prevent battery drain
- Use efficient data structures for pattern recognition
- Implement memory-conscious algorithms for large datasets

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test individual validation algorithms with synthetic data
- Verify edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test algorithm performance with large datasets
- Validate configuration handling for different strictness levels

**Integration Testing:**
- Test end-to-end validation workflow with real usage sessions
- Verify CloudKit integration and data persistence
- Test notification delivery for flagged sessions
- Validate parent override functionality

**Anti-Gaming Scenario Testing:**
- Create test scenarios for known gaming techniques
- Verify detection accuracy and false positive rates
- Test with legitimate usage patterns to ensure proper functionality
- Performance testing with high-volume usage data

### Security and Privacy Considerations

**COPPA Compliance:**
- All validation data remains within family's private CloudKit zone
- No behavioral analysis data shared outside family account
- Validation algorithms process usage patterns, not content
- Parental consent covers usage pattern analysis for gaming prevention

**Data Privacy:**
- Validation metadata stored encrypted via CloudKit
- No personally identifiable patterns tracked
- Audit logs limited to validation decisions and confidence scores
- Data retention aligned with family account lifecycle

**Algorithm Transparency:**
- Validation decisions include confidence scores and reasoning
- Parents can view detailed validation reports
- Clear documentation of validation criteria
- Appeal process for disputed validation decisions

### File Structure and Implementation

- `ScreenTimeRewards/Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/PointCalculationService.swift` (integrate validation)

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Algorithm Tuning:** Validation thresholds require careful calibration to balance security and usability
2. **Performance Impact:** Validation processing must not impact real-time usage tracking performance
3. **Parent Trust:** Transparent validation decisions build parent confidence in system integrity
4. **Child Experience:** Validation should be invisible to children during normal usage
5. **Scalability:** Algorithms must handle varying family sizes and usage patterns efficiently
6. **Accessibility:** Validation must account for accessibility needs and alternative interaction patterns
