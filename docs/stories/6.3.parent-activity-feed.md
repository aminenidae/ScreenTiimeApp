# Story 6.3: Parent Activity Feed

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a parent**,
**I want to see a chronological feed of my co-parent's activities**,
**so that I can stay informed about changes they've made to our family's settings.**

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Activity Feed UI**
   - Dedicated "Activity" tab in the parent dashboard
   - Chronological list of co-parent activities
   - Each activity shows: parent name, action type, target entity, timestamp
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Empty state with onboarding message

2. **Activity Types**
   - App categorization changes (added/modified/removed)
   - Point adjustments (manual additions/subtractions)
   - Reward redemptions
   - Child profile modifications
   - Settings updates
   - New child added

3. **Activity Data Model**
   - `ParentActivity` struct with id, familyID, triggeringUserID, activityType, targetEntity, targetEntityID, changes, timestamp
   - `ParentActivityType` enum with cases for each activity type
   - Rich change descriptions with before/after values when applicable

4. **Activity Retrieval**
   - Fetch activities from CloudKit parent coordination zone
   - Query by family ID, sorted by timestamp descending
   - Pagination support for large activity histories
   - Offline caching with CoreData

5. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Subscribe to new activities via CloudKit notifications
   - Update feed automatically when new activities are detected
   - Badge indicator on activity tab when new activities arrive
   - Smooth animations for new activity insertion

6. **Activity Details**
   - Tap on activity to see detailed change information
   - Show before/after values for modifications
   - Display related child profile when applicable
   - Option to navigate to affected entity

7. **Privacy & Performance**
   - Only show activities from family members (not external users)
   - Limit activity history to last 30 days
   - Efficient querying with proper CloudKit indexes
   - Memory-efficient UI with cell recycling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 6.2 completion: The real-time synchronization system is now complete with robust CloudKit zones, subscriptions, and Combine publishers. The ParentCoordinationEvent model and services established in this story can be leveraged for the activity feed. The CloudKit subscription patterns and background processing architecture can be reused for activity notifications.

### Data Models
**New ParentActivity Model Required**:
```swift
public struct ParentActivity: Codable, Identifiable {
    public let id: UUID
    public let familyID: UUID
    public let triggeringUserID: String
    public let activityType: ParentActivityType
    public let targetEntity: String
    public let targetEntityID: UUID
    public let changes: CodableDictionary
    public let timestamp: Date
    public let deviceID: String?
}

public enum ParentActivityType: String, Codable {
    case appCategorizationAdded
    case appCategorizationModified
    case appCategorizationRemoved
    case pointsAdjusted
    case rewardRedeemed
    case childProfileModified
    case settingsUpdated
    case childAdded
}
```

### CloudKit Architecture
**Parent Coordination Zone** [Source: docs/architecture.md]:
- Reuse existing parent coordination CloudKit zone for activity storage
- Create new `ParentActivity` record type in the coordination zone
- Leverage existing CloudKit subscription infrastructure for real-time updates
- Use existing zone-based architecture for granular sync and conflict resolution

**CloudKit Subscriptions** [Source: docs/architecture.md]:
- Extend existing `CKQuerySubscription` for parent coordination events
- Filter by family ID to ensure parents only receive relevant activities
- Configure with `.firesOnRecordCreation` option for activity notifications

### Real-Time Updates with Combine
**Event-Driven Updates** [Source: docs/architecture.md]:
- Extend existing Combine publishers in ParentCoordinationService
- Real-time multi-parent activity feed without polling
- Minimal battery impact via APNs

**Combine Publishers Implementation**:
```swift
class ParentActivityService: ObservableObject {
    func activitiesPublisher(for familyID: UUID) -> AnyPublisher<[ParentActivity], Error>
}
```

### UI Components & Patterns
**Activity Feed View** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- Use standard SwiftUI List with dynamic row heights
- Implement pull-to-refresh with Refreshable modifier
- Follow DesignSystem patterns for cards, timestamps, and avatars
- Use NavigationLink for detailed activity views

**Tab Bar Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- Add new "Activity" tab to existing parent dashboard tab view
- Implement badge indicator using UITabBarItem API
- Follow existing tab bar styling and navigation patterns
