### File Locations and Naming
- StoreKit configuration: Project root or `Resources/` directory
- CloudKit configuration: Xcode project settings and CloudKit console
- Build configuration: Xcode project settings
- Code quality configuration: Project root (`.swiftlint.yml`, `.swiftformat`)
- Test configuration: Test scheme files in Xcode
- Environment configuration: Build configurations in Xcode

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (StoreKit 2 and CloudKit framework dependency)
- **Build System:** Xcode Build System with Swift Package Manager
- **Subscription System:** StoreKit 2 framework for subscription management
- **Code Quality:** SwiftLint and SwiftFormat integration mandatory
- **Testing:** XCTest for unit testing, XCUITest for UI testing

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- Secure handling of StoreKit configuration files
- Environment isolation between Development and Production
- Proper error handling for environment switching
- Secure storage of test credentials and certificates

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests in `Tests/` directory
- UI tests in `Tests/UITests/` directory

- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names
- **Coverage:** All public interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- StoreKit configuration must be validated in simulator
- CloudKit connectivity must be tested in both environments
- Build configurations must be verified for all environments
- Development environment tools must be tested
- Testing configurations must be validated
- Environment switching must be verified
