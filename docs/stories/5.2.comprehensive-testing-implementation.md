## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Testing Framework:** XCTest native framework [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Primary testing framework for all test types
- XCUITest for UI/end-to-end tests
- Swift Package Manager test targets for each package

**Test Structure:** 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests focus on individual functions and classes
- Integration tests verify package interactions
- E2E tests validate complete user workflows

**Test File Location:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Package-specific test directories:
  - `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/`
  - `Packages/CloudKitService/Tests/`
  - `Packages/FamilyControlsKit/Tests/`
  - `Packages/SubscriptionService/Tests/`
  - `Packages/SharedModels/Tests/`
- UI tests in main app test target
- Performance tests in dedicated test target

**Testing Patterns:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Repository mocking for backend-independent testing
- Protocol-based dependency injection for testability
- Combine publisher testing with expectation-based async testing
- UI testing with accessibility identifiers

**Code Coverage Goal:** >90% for all core packages [Source: Story AC #1]
- Measured using Xcode's built-in code coverage tool
- Coverage reports generated for each package
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage

### Specific Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Requirements:**
- Test all business logic functions with edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (CloudKit, Family Controls)
- Verify error handling paths
- Test data model serialization/deserialization
- Validate validation algorithms (from Story 5.1)

**Integration Testing Requirements:**
- Test CloudKit zone creation and management
- Verify point calculation and transaction recording
- Test subscription purchase flow and receipt validation
- Validate multi-parent sync scenarios (prepare for Epic 6)
- Test offline/online transition handling

**User Acceptance Testing Requirements:**
- Test on physical iOS devices (iPhone and iPad)
- Validate COPPA compliance in user flows
- Test accessibility features
- Verify family controls integration
- Test subscription purchase and management flows

**Performance Testing Requirements:**
- Battery impact monitoring with MetricKit [Source: architecture.md]
- Storage usage validation with app size measurements
- Launch time measurement with XCTMeasure
- CloudKit sync performance with large datasets
- Stress testing with concurrent user scenarios

### File Structure and Implementation

**New Test Files to Create:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- `Packages/SharedModels/Tests/SharedModelsTests/`
- `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/`
- `Packages/CloudKitService/Tests/CloudKitServiceTests/`

- `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/UITests/`
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/IntegrationTests/`
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/PerformanceTests/`

**Test Data Management:**
- Use mock data generators for consistent test data
- Implement test data cleanup between test runs
- Use in-memory stores for unit tests
- Use CloudKit test environments for integration tests

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Completed Stories Required:**
- Story 1.1: Project setup with Swift Package Manager packages
- Story 1.3: CloudKit setup with repository protocols
- Story 1.7: App discovery service foundation
- Story 2.1: App categorization UI
- Story 2.2: Point tracking engine
- Story 2.3: Reward redemption UI
- Story 5.1: Usage validation algorithms

**Architecture Dependencies:**
- Repository pattern implementation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- CloudKit zone-based architecture [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Protocol-based testing approach [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Test Coverage Priority:** Focus on RewardCore and CloudKitService packages first as they contain core business logic
2. **Mocking Strategy:** Use protocol-based mocking for all external dependencies
3. **Performance Testing:** Use Xcode's XCTMetric for accurate performance measurements
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Tests must run successfully in Xcode Cloud CI/CD pipeline [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
5. **Physical Device Testing:** Critical for Family Controls and Screen Time API testing
6. **Accessibility Testing:** Verify all UI elements are accessible per WCAG AA standards [Source: prd.md]
7. **COPPA Compliance Testing:** Ensure no data collection without parental consent
