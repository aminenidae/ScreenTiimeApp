# Epic 6: Multi-Parent Collaboration & Real-Time Synchronization

## Goal

Enable multiple parents to collaboratively manage family accounts with real-time synchronization and conflict resolution. This epic delivers the infrastructure and user experience needed for families with multiple caregivers to coordinate their children's screen time management.

## Requirements Addressed

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR11: Multiple parents can access and manage the same child's profile and settings
- FR12: Changes made by one parent are synchronized in real-time to other parents
- FR13: Parents can communicate with each other through the app about screen time decisions
- FR14: Appropriate permissions and access controls ensure only authorized parents can make changes

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- NFR11: Real-time synchronization must work across multiple parent devices with <5 second delay
- NFR12: Conflict resolution must handle simultaneous edits by multiple parents

## Stories

### Story 6.1: Parent Invitation System

**As a parent, I want to invite co-parents to collaborate on managing our children's screen time, so that we can both contribute to our family's digital wellness.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Parent invitation flow is implemented using iCloud Family Sharing
2. Deep link handling enables seamless onboarding for invited parents
3. Family member discovery automatically identifies co-parents in the same iCloud family
4. Invitation system gracefully handles edge cases (non-family members, declined invitations)
5. Security measures ensure only authorized parents can join the family account
6. Onboarding flow guides new parents through initial setup

### Story 6.2: Real-Time Synchronization Infrastructure

**As a developer, I want to implement real-time synchronization infrastructure, so that changes made by one parent are immediately visible to other parents.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. CloudKit zone architecture supports real-time multi-parent collaboration
2. Combine publishers and CloudKit subscriptions enable reactive UI updates
3. APNs integration provides push notifications for real-time updates
4. Network resilience handles connectivity issues gracefully
5. Sync performance maintains <5 second delay for updates
6. Battery impact is minimized through efficient push notification handling

### Story 6.3: Parent Activity Feed

**As a parent, I want to see a feed of activities from other parents, so that I can stay informed about changes to our children's settings.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Activity feed displays recent changes made by co-parents
2. Real-time updates appear in the feed as changes occur
3. Activity items include who made the change, what was changed, and when
4. Feed is organized chronologically with newest items first
5. Parents can filter activities by type or co-parent
6. Activity feed integrates with push notifications for important changes

### Story 6.4: Permissions & Access Control

**As a family owner, I want to control co-parent permissions, so that I can manage who can make changes.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Permission roles are defined (Owner, Co-Parent, Viewer - planned for v1.2)
2. Permission enforcement is implemented at repository and UI levels
3. UI permission indicators show role information
4. Owner transfer documentation is prepared for v1.2
5. Error handling provides clear alerts for unauthorized actions
6. CloudKit security aligns with role-based permissions

### Story 6.5: Conflict Resolution

**As a parent, I want the app to handle conflicts when multiple parents make changes simultaneously, so that no one's changes are lost.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Conflict detection identifies simultaneous edits by multiple parents
2. Conflict resolution strategies handle common scenarios automatically
3. Manual conflict resolution UI allows parents to choose preferred changes
4. Merge capabilities enable combining non-conflicting changes
5. Conflict metadata is stored for audit and future algorithm improvement
6. User-friendly notifications alert parents to conflicts requiring attention
