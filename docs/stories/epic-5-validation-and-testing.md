# Epic 5: Validation & Testing

## Goal
Implement usage validation algorithms and comprehensive testing to ensure system integrity. This epic will deliver confidence that the app works correctly and cannot be easily gamed by children.

## Stories

### Story 5.1: Usage Validation Algorithm Implementation
As a developer, I want to implement usage validation algorithms, so that children cannot easily game the system to earn points without genuine educational engagement.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Gaming detection algorithms identify and flag at least 5 common gaming techniques with >90% accuracy
2. Engagement detection system distinguishes passive usage from active engagement with <10% false positive rate
3. Validation system operates with configurable strictness levels (lenient, moderate, strict) with appropriate thresholds
4. False positive prevention mechanisms reduce incorrect flagging to <5% of legitimate usage sessions
5. Validation results are integrated with the point calculation system to adjust point awards based on confidence scores
6. Parent notification system alerts parents when sessions are flagged with >75% confidence as suspicious
7. Validation metadata is stored with usage sessions for audit and future algorithm improvement

Status: 📝 Ready for Development

### Story 5.2: Comprehensive Testing Implementation
As a QA engineer, I want to conduct comprehensive testing of all core features, so that we can ensure the app works correctly before release.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Unit tests cover all core functionality with >90% coverage
2. Integration tests verify system components work together
3. User acceptance tests validate the experience for both parents and children
4. Performance tests confirm acceptable battery and storage impact

### Story 5.3: Error Handling and Recovery Implementation
As a developer, I want to implement error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that the app remains stable even when unexpected issues occur.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Graceful error handling is implemented for all critical functions
2. Data recovery mechanisms protect against data loss
3. User-friendly error messages guide users through issues
4. Logging helps diagnose and resolve problems

Status: 📝 Not Started

### Story 5.4: App Store Compliance and Production Deployment
As a product manager, I want to validate App Store compliance and execute production deployment, so that the app can be successfully published and maintained.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. App Store Review Guidelines compliance
2. COPPA compliance verified and documented
3. Legal and policy requirements met
4. Pre-submission validation completed
5. Production deployment executed successfully
