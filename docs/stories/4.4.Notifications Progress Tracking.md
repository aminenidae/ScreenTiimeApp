# Story 4.4: Notifications Progress Tracking

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** parent,
**I want** to receive notifications about my child's progress,
**so that** I can stay engaged with their educational journey.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Notification system is implemented for key events with reliable delivery
2. Parents can customize notification preferences with granular control over event types
3. Notifications are timely and relevant based on child's learning activity
4. Notification frequency is reasonable with batching to avoid annoyance (max 3 notifications per day)
5. Notifications respect quiet hours (8 PM - 8 AM) by default
6. Parents can opt out of all notifications with one setting

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific insights from previous stories required for this implementation.

### Data Models
**NotificationPreferences** (part of ChildProfile):
- `enabledNotifications`: Set of NotificationEvent enum values
- `quietHoursStart`: Date (time component only)
- `quietHoursEnd`: Date (time component only)
- `digestMode`: Bool (daily digest vs real-time)
- `lastNotificationSent`: Date (for cooldown tracking)
- `notificationsEnabled`: Bool (master opt-out switch)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ChildProfile]

**NotificationEvent enum values:**
- `.pointsEarned`, `.goalAchieved`, `.weeklyMilestone`, `.streakAchieved`
[Source: architecture/data-models.md - to be added to NotificationEventType enum]

### API Specifications
No external API specifications required - uses native iOS UserNotifications framework.
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Local Notifications]

### Component Specifications
**NotificationSettingsView** component:
- Location: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Settings/Views/NotificationSettingsView.swift`
- Props: `viewModel: NotificationSettingsViewModel`
- Uses DesignSystem toggle components and section headers
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**NotificationService** service:
- Location: `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/Services/NotificationService.swift`
- Uses UserNotifications framework with privacy-first approach
- Implements batching and intelligent scheduling logic
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Local Notifications]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Service: `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/Services/NotificationService.swift`
- Settings UI: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Settings/Views/NotificationSettingsView.swift`
- ViewModel: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/Settings/ViewModels/NotificationSettingsViewModel.swift`
- Data Models: Extend existing ChildProfile in `Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/ChildProfile.swift`
- Tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Settings/NotificationSettingsTests.swift`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing (70% of tests):**
- Test NotificationService scheduling logic
- Test notification preference validation
- Test quiet hours calculation
- Test cooldown period enforcement
- Test notification batching algorithm

**Integration Testing (20% of tests):**
- Test notification settings UI integration
- Test notification delivery with CloudKit sync
- Test notification permission flow
- Test timezone change handling

**E2E Testing (10% of tests):**
- Test complete notification setup flow
- Test notification delivery in app lifecycle scenarios
- Test opt-out functionality
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- iOS 15.0+ UserNotifications framework support
- COPPA compliance: No push notifications to children under 13 without explicit parental consent
- Battery impact: Minimize background processing for notification scheduling
- Privacy: All notifications processed locally, no server-side notification service
- Accessibility: Notification settings must be fully accessible via VoiceOver
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Local Notifications, COPPA requirements]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `Tests/RewardCoreTests/Services/NotificationServiceTests.swift`
- UI tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/Settings/NotificationSettingsUITests.swift`
- Integration tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Integration/NotificationIntegrationTests.swift`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- XCTest for unit and integration testing
- XCUITest for end-to-end UI testing
- Mock UserNotifications for controlled testing scenarios

**Testing Patterns:**
- Repository pattern mocking for CloudKit dependencies
- Notification delivery simulation for testing
- Time-based testing with controlled date mocking

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test notification authorization flow
- Test quiet hours enforcement across timezone changes
- Test notification batching prevents spam
- Test COPPA compliance for child notification consent
- Test accessibility of notification settings
- Test edge cases: network loss, device restart, multiple children
