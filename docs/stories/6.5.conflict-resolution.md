## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 6.4 completion: The permissions system is now complete with robust role-based access control. The ConflictResolver can leverage the PermissionService to determine which parent's changes should take precedence in conflict scenarios. The CloudKit record-level permissions and error handling patterns established in this story can be reused for conflict resolution.

From Story 6.3 completion: The parent activity feed is now complete with real-time updates and CloudKit coordination events. The ParentActivity model and services established in this story can be extended to track conflict resolution events. The real-time update patterns can be reused for conflict notifications.

From Story 6.2 completion: The real-time synchronization system is now complete with robust CloudKit zones, subscriptions, and Combine publishers. The synchronization infrastructure established in this story provides the foundation for detecting conflicts. The CloudKit subscription patterns can be leveraged for conflict detection notifications.

From Story 6.1 completion: The parent invitation system is now complete with robust CloudKit sharing integration. The family member discovery and role assignment mechanisms can inform conflict resolution priority logic. The CloudKit sharing patterns can be reused for conflict metadata sharing.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the conflict resolution feature is well-structured and follows good architectural patterns. The code is organized into appropriate modules with clear separation of concerns:
- Conflict detection logic is separated in the ConflictDetector service
- Resolution strategies are implemented in the ConflictResolver service
- CloudKit integration is handled by the CloudKitConflictHandler
- UI components are well-designed and follow SwiftUI best practices

The code demonstrates good use of Swift concurrency with async/await patterns, proper error handling, and adherence to the project's coding standards.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the implementation quality is already high.
