# Story 6.2: Real-Time Synchronization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a parent**,
**I want changes I make to sync in real-time to my co-parent's device**,
**so that we always see consistent data.**

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Parent Coordination Zone**
   - Dedicated CloudKit zone: `parent-coordination-{familyID}`
   - `ParentCoordinationEvent` record type stores change events

2. **CloudKit Subscriptions**
   - `CKQuerySubscription` for each parent device
   - Filters by family ID, excludes own changes
   - Silent push notifications enabled

3. **Push Notification Handling**
   - Background fetch retrieves coordination events
   - Local cache updated
   - UI updates via Combine publishers

4. **Change Detection & Publishing**
   - All mutations create coordination events
   - Events contain sufficient detail for transparency

5. **UI Real-Time Updates**
   - ViewModels subscribe to coordination service
   - Toast notifications for co-parent changes
   - Smooth transition animations

6. **Synchronization Guarantees**
   - <5 second latency target (NFR11)
   - Retry logic, offline queue
   - Idempotent event handling

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debouncing (300ms)
   - Batch operations
   - Efficient delta sync

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 6.1 completion: The parent invitation system is now complete with robust CloudKit sharing integration and deep link handling. The CloudKit subscription patterns established in this story can be leveraged for real-time synchronization. The Family.sharedWithUserIDs field is now properly populated with co-parent information.

### Data Models
**New ParentCoordinationEvent Model Required**:
```swift
struct ParentCoordinationEvent {
    let id: UUID
    let familyID: UUID
    let triggeringUserID: String
    let eventType: ParentCoordinationEventType
    let targetEntity: String
    let targetEntityID: UUID
    let changes: [String: Any]
    let timestamp: Date
    let deviceID: String?
}
```

**ParentCoordinationEventType Enum**:
```swift
enum ParentCoordinationEventType {
    case appCategorizationChanged
    case settingsUpdated
    case pointsAdjusted
    case rewardRedeemed
    case childProfileModified
}
```

### CloudKit Architecture
**Parent Coordination Zone** [Source: docs/architecture.md#CloudKit Implementation Notes]:
- Dedicated CloudKit zone: `CKRecordZone(zoneName: "parent-coordination")` for multi-parent real-time sync
- Custom record types for coordination events
- Zone-based architecture for granular sync and conflict resolution

**CloudKit Subscriptions** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Subscription Example]:
- Use `CKQuerySubscription` for real-time notifications
- Filter by family ID to ensure parents only receive relevant updates
- Configure with `.firesOnRecordUpdate` option for immediate notifications

### Real-Time Updates with Combine
**Event-Driven Updates** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]:
- CloudKit subscriptions + Combine publishers for reactive UI
- Real-time multi-parent collaboration without polling
- Minimal battery impact via APNs

**Combine Publishers Implementation**:
```swift
class ParentCoordinationService: ObservableObject {
    func coordinationEventsPublisher(for familyID: UUID) -> AnyPublisher<ParentCoordinationEvent, Error>
}
```

### File Locations
**Based on Project Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Unified Project Structure]:

- Coordination Service: `ScreenTimeRewards/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/Services/`
- UI Integration: `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/Features/` (various features)

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Performance Optimization]:
- Synchronization latency <5 seconds (NFR11)
- Efficient data structures for real-time updates
- Memory-efficient UI components using SwiftUI

**Background Processing** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Background Processing Architecture]:
- Use BackgroundTasks Framework for handling coordination events when app is in background
- BGAppRefreshTask for periodic sync maintenance
- Proper error handling for background operations

### Testing Requirements

- CloudKit tests: `ScreenTimeRewards/CloudKitService/Tests/CloudKitServiceTests/`
- Integration tests: `ScreenTimeRewards/Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Integration/`

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Test background fetch handling for coordination events
- Test UI update mechanisms with Combine publishers
- Test performance optimizations (debouncing, batching)
