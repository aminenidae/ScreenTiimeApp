## Dev Notes

### Dependencies and Integration Points

**Previous Stories Required:**
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (CloudKit, auth, data models)
- Epic 2: Core Reward System (usage tracking, point system)
- Epic 3: User Experience & Interface (dashboard components)
- Story 4.1: Detailed Reports (reporting infrastructure)

### Relationship to Epic Goals
This story is part of Epic 4: Reporting & Analytics, which aims to provide detailed usage reports and analytics for parents to monitor progress and adjust settings. This specific story focuses on implementing comprehensive data analytics capabilities that will inform product development and help understand user behavior patterns while maintaining strict privacy protections.

### Architecture Context
This story implements privacy-first analytics capabilities that collect anonymous usage data to improve the app while strictly protecting family privacy. The analytics system builds on existing data models and repositories established in previous epics and integrates with Apple's MetricKit framework for system-level metrics.

### Data Model Dependencies
**Primary Data Sources** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- Fields: `startTime`, `endTime`, `durationSeconds`, `pointsEarned`, `childProfileID`, `appCategorizationID`
- Provides foundation for usage pattern analytics

**PointTransaction Model:**
- Fields: `type`, `amount`, `timestamp`, `balanceAfter`, `childProfileID`
- Enables point earning and spending behavior analytics

**AppCategorization Model:**
- Fields: `category`, `pointsPerHour`, `appName`, `bundleIdentifier`, `childProfileID`
- Supports app category preference analytics

**FamilySettings Model:**
- Fields: `defaultPointsPerHour`, `conversionRate`, `minimumSessionMinutes`

}

struct AnalyticsEvent {
    let id: UUID
    let eventType: AnalyticsEventType
    let timestamp: Date
    let anonymizedUserID: String     // Hashed family ID
    let sessionID: String           // Analytics session identifier
    let appVersion: String
    let osVersion: String
    let deviceModel: String         // Anonymized device type
    let metadata: [String: Any]     // Additional event-specific data
}
```

``swift
enum AggregationType {
    case daily
    case weekly
    case monthly
}

struct AnalyticsAggregation {
    let id: UUID
    let aggregationType: AggregationType
    let startDate: Date
    let endDate: Date
    let totalUsers: Int             // Anonymous count
    let totalSessions: Int
    let averageSessionDuration: TimeInterval
    let featureUsageCounts: [String: Int]
    let retentionMetrics: RetentionMetrics
    let performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetrics
}

struct RetentionMetrics {

```

**AnalyticsConsent Model:**
```swift
enum AnalyticsConsentLevel {
    case none                       // No analytics collection
    case essential                  // Crash reports and critical metrics only
    case standard                   // Feature usage and performance
    case detailed                   // Comprehensive analytics (default)
}

struct AnalyticsConsent {
    let familyID: UUID
    let consentLevel: AnalyticsConsentLevel
    let consentDate: Date
    let consentVersion: String      // Legal consent version
    let ipAddress: String?          // For legal compliance

}
```

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Service Architecture** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Package Location:** `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/Analytics/`
- **Service Class:** `AnalyticsService` implementing privacy-first collection
- **Repository Integration:** Use existing CloudKit repository patterns
- **Local Processing:** Use device-side aggregation before cloud storage

**Privacy-First Design:**
- All analytics data is anonymized before collection
- Family IDs are hashed using SHA-256 with app-specific salt
- Individual user actions are aggregated before storage
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- Parents have full control over analytics consent levels

**MetricKit Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework:** MetricKit for system-level performance metrics
- **Usage:** Battery, memory, CPU, crash, and hang reporting
- **Data Processing:** Aggregate system metrics with user behavior analytics
- **Privacy:** MetricKit data is already anonymized by Apple

### Analytics Collection Framework

**Event Tracking Architecture:**
``swift
protocol AnalyticsEventCollector {
    func trackEvent(_ event: AnalyticsEvent) async
    func trackFeatureUsage(feature: String, metadata: [String: Any]?) async
    func trackUserFlow(flow: String, step: String) async
    func trackPerformance(metric: String, value: Double) async
}

class PrivacyFirstAnalyticsCollector: AnalyticsEventCollector {
    private let consentService: AnalyticsConsentService
    private let anonymizationService: DataAnonymizationService
    private let aggregationService: AnalyticsAggregationService

    // Implements privacy-preserving collection with local aggregation
}
```

**Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Feature Usage Analytics:**
   - App categorization frequency and patterns
   - Point redemption behaviors and preferences
   - Settings modification patterns
   - Goal creation and completion rates

2. **Engagement Analytics:**
   - Daily/weekly active families
   - Session duration and frequency
   - Feature adoption rates
   - User flow completion rates

3. **Performance Analytics:**
   - App launch time and responsiveness
   - CloudKit sync performance
   - Battery impact measurements
   - Memory usage patterns

4. **Product Analytics:**
   - Subscription conversion rates
   - Feature request patterns (via error tracking)
   - Churn indicators and retention metrics
   - A/B testing framework support

### Privacy and Compliance Requirements

**COPPA Compliance:**
- All analytics related to children are aggregated and anonymized
- No individual child behavior tracking
- Parental consent required for any analytics collection
- Data retention limited to product improvement purposes only

**Data Anonymization:**
- Family IDs hashed with cryptographic salt
- Device identifiers anonymized using consistent but non-reversible hashing
- Geographic data limited to country/region level only
- Time-based data rounded to prevent correlation attacks

**Consent Management:**
- Clear consent screens explaining analytics collection
- Granular consent levels (none, essential, standard, detailed)
- Easy opt-out mechanisms in settings
- Consent withdrawal removes all previously collected data

### CloudKit Integration

**Analytics Data Storage:**
- Anonymous analytics stored in public CloudKit database
- No association with family accounts or personal data
- Aggregated data only, no individual event storage
- Automatic data purging after retention period

**Data Aggregation Pipeline:**
1. Local event collection with immediate anonymization
2. Device-side daily aggregation to protect individual patterns
3. CloudKit upload of aggregated data only
4. Server-side weekly/monthly aggregation for insights
5. Raw event data purged after aggregation

### Analytics Dashboard Implementation

**UI Components** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - SwiftUI]
- **Charts Framework:** Use native SwiftUI components for data visualization
- **Dashboard Layout:** Integrate with existing DesignSystem package
- **Export Features:** PDF and CSV export for analytical reports
- **Real-time Updates:** Combine publishers for live analytics updates

**Dashboard Sections:**
1. **Usage Overview:** High-level family engagement metrics
2. **Feature Performance:** Most/least used features
3. **Trend Analysis:** Week-over-week and month-over-month comparisons
4. **System Health:** Performance and crash metrics
5. **Product Insights:** Conversion funnels and user journey analytics

### Testing Strategy
