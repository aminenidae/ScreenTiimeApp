  - [ ] Test ViewModel error state management
  - [ ] Test logging service functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 5.2, comprehensive testing infrastructure is now in place with >90% code coverage across all packages. XCTest framework and mock data generators are established. This provides a solid foundation for testing error handling scenarios. [Source: Previous Story 5.2 Dev Agent Record]

### Error Handling Architecture

**Error Types and Hierarchy:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- AppError enum with LocalizedError conformance provides user-friendly messages
- Specific error cases: networkUnavailable, cloudKitNotAvailable, insufficientPoints, unauthorized
- Error descriptions include recovery guidance for users

**ViewModel Error Pattern:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- @Published errorMessage and showError properties for UI binding
- MainActor-marked ViewModels for thread-safe error updates
- Async/await error handling with do-catch blocks

**Logging Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- OSLog (Unified Logging) for structured logging with privacy categories
- MetricKit for performance and crash monitoring (privacy-preserving)
- Console.app integration for debugging and diagnostics

### Data Models and Error Handling

**CloudKit Error Handling:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Repository pattern abstracts CloudKit errors to domain errors
- Zone management error handling for child zone creation
- Atomic operations for point balance updates with error recovery

**Repository Implementation:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Protocol-based repositories enable error handling abstraction
- AnyPublisher<T, Error> return types for async error propagation
- Future/Promise pattern for CloudKit operation error handling

### File Locations and Structure

**Error Handling Files:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/AppError.swift` - Central error definitions
- `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/LoggingService.swift` - Logging service implementation
- `Packages/RewardCore/Sources/RewardCore/Services/ErrorHandlingService.swift` - Error handling utilities
- `Packages/*/Sources/*/Repository/*` - Repository-level error handling
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/*/ViewModels/*` - ViewModel error state management

**Test Files:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `Packages/SharedModels/Tests/SharedModelsTests/AppErrorTests.swift` - Error definition tests
- `Packages/RewardCore/Tests/RewardCoreTests/LoggingServiceTests.swift` - Logging tests
- `Packages/*/Tests/*/` - Package-specific error handling tests

### Technical Constraints and Standards

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All async operations must handle errors (Critical Rule #4)
- Use repository protocols only for CloudKit access (Critical Rule #2)
- ViewModels own @Published state including error states (Critical Rule #3)

**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Swift 5.9+ with modern concurrency for error handling
- SwiftUI @Published for reactive error state binding
- CloudKit Framework native error types and handling
- XCTest for error scenario testing

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests pyramid
- Mock CloudKit dependencies via protocols for error testing
- XCTest framework for comprehensive error scenario coverage

### Security and Performance Considerations

**Error Message Security:** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Error messages must not expose sensitive information
- Use OSLog privacy categories to protect user data in logs
- Sanitize error details before user presentation

**Performance Impact:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- MetricKit monitoring for error-related performance impacts
- Minimize logging overhead in production builds
- Efficient error recovery mechanisms to maintain app responsiveness

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Completed Stories Required:**
- Story 1.3: CloudKit setup with repository protocols
- Story 5.1: Usage validation algorithms (error handling for validation)
- Story 5.2: Comprehensive testing implementation (test infrastructure)

**Architecture Dependencies:**
- Repository pattern implementation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- CloudKit native error handling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- SwiftUI reactive state management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Error Scenario Testing:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test all defined error types and their user messages
- Mock CloudKit errors to test repository error handling
- Test ViewModel error state updates and UI presentation
- Test error recovery mechanisms and data consistency

**Integration Testing:**
- Test error handling across package boundaries
- Test offline/online transition error scenarios
- Test CloudKit conflict resolution error handling

**User Experience Testing:**
- Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Test error recovery workflows from user perspective
- Validate accessibility of error presentation
