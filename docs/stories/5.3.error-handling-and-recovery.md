### Previous Story Insights
From Story 5.2, comprehensive testing infrastructure is now in place with >90% code coverage across all packages. XCTest framework and mock data generators are established. This provides a solid foundation for testing error handling scenarios. [Source: Previous Story 5.2 Dev Agent Record]

### Error Handling Architecture

**Error Types and Hierarchy:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- AppError enum with LocalizedError conformance provides user-friendly messages
- Specific error cases: networkUnavailable, cloudKitNotAvailable, insufficientPoints, unauthorized
- Error descriptions include recovery guidance for users

**ViewModel Error Pattern:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- @Published errorMessage and showError properties for UI binding
- MainActor-marked ViewModels for thread-safe error updates
- Async/await error handling with do-catch blocks

**Logging Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- OSLog (Unified Logging) for structured logging with privacy categories
- MetricKit for performance and crash monitoring (privacy-preserving)
- Console.app integration for debugging and diagnostics

### Data Models and Error Handling

**CloudKit Error Handling:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Repository pattern abstracts CloudKit errors to domain errors
- Zone management error handling for child zone creation
- Atomic operations for point balance updates with error recovery

**Repository Implementation:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
