- UI Components: `ScreenTimeRewards/Features/ChildDashboard/Views/Components/`
- Unit tests: `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/ChildDashboard/`
- Integration tests: `Tests/IntegrationTests/ChildDashboardTests/`

### Technical Constraints [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (Family Controls framework dependency)
- **Device Requirement:** Physical device required for Family Controls testing
- **Framework Dependency:** Native Family Controls framework only
- **Privacy Compliance:** COPPA regulations must be maintained
- **Performance:** Efficient UI with minimal battery impact

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- Family Controls requires proper child authorization
- Secure storage of child data in CloudKit private zones
- Respect privacy boundaries for child usage data
- Proper error handling for authorization failures

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- Unit tests in `Tests/ScreenTimeRewardsTests/Features/ChildDashboard/` directory
- Integration tests in `Tests/IntegrationTests/ChildDashboardTests/` directory

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names
- **Coverage:** All public interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test Child Dashboard View with various point balances (0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Verify real-time updates with CloudKit subscriptions
- Validate data loading and error handling
- Test reward display and selection
- Verify navigation to other screens
- Physical device testing for Family Controls functionality

- Multiple simultaneous point updates
- Child profile with no avatar image
- Different screen sizes (iPhone SE to iPad Pro)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Dashboard loading time: < 500ms
- Point update animation duration: 300ms
- CloudKit subscription update time: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB when dashboard is active

### Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements have accessibility labels
- VoiceOver support for all dashboard components
- Large touch targets (minimum 44pt x 44pt)
- High contrast mode support
- Dynamic text size support (Large Text accessibility setting)
