## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements comprehensive reporting and analytics functionality that aggregates data from multiple sources to provide parents with insights into their children's digital habits. The feature builds on existing data models and repositories established in Epic 1-3.

### Data Model Dependencies
**Primary Data Sources** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**UsageSession Model:**
- Tracks continuous app usage periods with precise timing
- Fields: `startTime`, `endTime`, `durationSeconds`, `pointsEarned`, `childProfileID`, `appCategorizationID`
- Provides foundation for all time-based analytics

**PointTransaction Model:**
- Immutable ledger of all point activities
- Fields: `type` (.earned, .redeemed, .adjusted), `amount`, `timestamp`, `balanceAfter`
- Enables point flow analysis and earning efficiency metrics

**AppCategorization Model:**
- Links apps to learning/reward categories with point values
- Fields: `category`, `pointsPerHour`, `appName`, `bundleIdentifier`
- Required for category-based breakdowns

**ChildProfile Model:**
- Individual child data with totals
- Fields: `pointBalance`, `totalPointsEarned`, `name`, `familyID`
- Provides child-specific context for reports

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Frontend Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Pattern:** Follow established SwiftUI MVVM pattern
- **ViewModel Structure:** `ReportsViewModel` with `@Published` properties for reactive UI
- **Navigation Integration:** Integrate with `AppCoordinator` routing system
- **State Management:** Use Combine publishers for real-time data updates

**Repository Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- **CloudKitSyncEngine:** Use existing repository protocols for data access
- **Data Aggregation:** Implement `DashboardService` pattern for complex queries
- **Reactive Streams:** Use Combine publishers for automatic updates
- **Offline Support:** Cache analytics data using CoreData for offline viewing

### UI Implementation Details

**Design System Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Charts Framework:** Use native Charts framework (iOS 16+) for data visualization
- **DesignSystem Package:** Use existing color tokens, typography, and spacing
- **SwiftUI Components:** Build on existing card and button components
- **SF Symbols:** Use system icons for report categories and actions

**Component Structure:**
```swift
ReportsView
├── ReportsPeriodSelector (Today/Week/Month/Custom)
├── ReportsTabView
│   ├── OverviewTab (summary cards, key metrics)
│   ├── CategoriesTab (learning vs reward breakdown)
│   └── TrendsTab (historical charts, patterns)
└── ReportsActionBar (export, share, print)
```

**Required View Components:**
- `ReportsView` - Main reports screen with tab navigation
- `ReportsSummaryCard` - Key metrics display (total time, points earned)
- `CategoryBreakdownChart` - Pie/bar chart for learning vs reward time
- `TrendLineChart` - Historical usage patterns over time
- `AppUsageDetailRow` - Individual app statistics
- `ExportOptionsSheet` - PDF/CSV export options

### Analytics Calculations

**Time-Based Metrics:**
- Daily/weekly/monthly usage totals
- Average session duration per app category
- Peak usage times and patterns
- Learning vs reward time ratios

**Point-Based Metrics:**
- Point earning efficiency (points per minute)
- Learning app ROI analysis
- Point redemption patterns
- Balance trend analysis

**Trend Analysis:**
- Week-over-week usage changes
- Streak tracking (consecutive learning days)
- Habit formation indicators
- Goal progress tracking

### Export and Sharing Features

**PDF Report Generation** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use PDFKit framework for professional report layouts
