# Story 1.3: CloudKit Schema, Repository Protocols, and Local Cache Setup

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up CloudKit schema, repository protocols, and local cache,
**so that** user data can be synchronized across devices and backed up securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CloudKit container is configured in Xcode project
2. CloudKit schema is deployed with record types:
   - `Family` (in shared zone)
   - `ChildProfile` (in custom zones)
   - `AppCategorization` (in child zones)
   - `UsageSession` (in child zones)
   - `PointTransaction` (in child zones)
   - `RewardRedemption` (in child zones)
   - `FamilySettings` (in shared zone)
   - `SubscriptionEntitlement` (in shared zone)
3. **CRITICAL: CloudKit schema deployment is validated and confirmed working before proceeding**
   - Test record creation/retrieval for each record type
   - Verify all indexes are properly configured and queryable
   - Confirm Development environment schema matches Production preparation
   - **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Execute end-to-end schema validation test**
     - Create test Family record → Save → Query → Update → Delete
     - Create test ChildProfile in private zone → Verify zone isolation
     - Test all 6 record types with proper field validation
     - Verify CloudKit Console shows all record types and indexes
     - **BLOCKING:** Epic 2 cannot start until this checkpoint passes
4. Custom CloudKit zones created (per-child private zones)
5. Repository protocol definitions are created in CloudKitService package:
   - `FamilyRepository` protocol
   - `ChildProfileRepository` protocol
   - `AppCategorizationRepository` protocol
   - `UsageSessionRepository` protocol
   - `PointTransactionRepository` protocol
   - `RewardRedemptionRepository` protocol
   - `FamilySettingsRepository` protocol
   - `SubscriptionEntitlementRepository` protocol
6. CoreData schema created for local cache (offline support)
7. Mock repository implementations created for testing
8. **Repository integration tests pass** - All repository protocols work with real CloudKit before Epic 2
9. Basic data models defined in SharedModels package (Family, ChildProfile, etc.)
10. Zone management service (`CloudKitZoneManager`) implemented
11. COPPA compliance measures implemented for data storage (age verification, parental consent)
12. **Checkpoint: Complete end-to-end test** (create Family record → save → retrieve → update → sync)

### CloudKit Schema Design [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Zone Isolation:** Per-child zones for privacy and granular sync
- **Denormalization:** `pointBalance` duplicates transaction sum for performance
- **Offline Queue:** `SyncQueueEntity` stores operations when offline
- **Indexes:** Compound indexes on frequently filtered fields
- **Soft Deletes:** Use `isActive` flags, preserve history

### CloudKit Record Types [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- `Family` (shared zone)
- `ChildProfile` (custom zones)
- `AppCategorization` (child zones)
- `UsageSession` (child zones)
- `PointTransaction` (child zones)
- `SubscriptionEntitlement` (shared zone)
- `FamilySettings` (shared zone)

### Repository Pattern Implementation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Protocol-based repositories abstract CloudKit
- CloudKit implementations handle record conversion
- Combine publishers for reactive data streams
- Atomic operations for point balance updates

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- `Family` - Family unit with multiple parents and children
- `ChildProfile` - Individual child account with point balance
- `AppCategorization` - Parent-defined app classification
- `UsageSession` - Tracks time spent in apps
- `PointTransaction` - Immutable ledger of point earnings
- `RewardRedemption` - Records point-to-time conversions
- `FamilySettings` - Configurable reward system parameters

### File Locations and Naming
- CloudKit configuration: Xcode project settings
- Repository protocols: `Packages/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/`
- CoreData model: `ScreenTimeRewards/Resources/`
- Data models: `Packages/SharedModels/Sources/SharedModels/`
- Zone management: `Packages/CloudKitService/Sources/CloudKitService/`
- Tests: `Tests/CloudKitServiceTests/`

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **iOS Version:** 15.0+ required (CloudKit framework dependency)
- **Zone Management:** Per-child private zones for data isolation
- **Offline Support:** CoreData cache for offline-first operations
- **COPPA Compliance:** Age verification and parental consent requirements
- **Conflict Resolution:** CloudKit system fields for multi-parent sync

### Security and Privacy Considerations
- Per-child zone isolation ensures data privacy
- COPPA compliance with age verification and parental consent
- End-to-end encryption via CloudKit
- Proper error handling for authorization failures

### Security Considerations for CloudKit Implementation
- Ensure all CloudKit operations are performed with proper error handling
- Implement secure error reporting that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Use CloudKit's built-in encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Validate all data before saving to CloudKit to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper access controls for shared data
- Ensure zone isolation is maintained for all child-specific data

## Testing

### Test Location [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests in `Tests/CloudKitServiceTests/` directory
- Integration tests in `Tests/IntegrationTests/` directory
- CoreData tests in `Tests/CoreDataTests/` directory

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework:** XCTest native framework
- **Pyramid:** 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E
- **Naming:** Descriptive test method names (e.g., `testCreateFamilyRecord_SavesToCloudKit`)
- **Coverage:** All public CloudKitService interfaces must have unit tests

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test CloudKit schema with real Development environment
- Verify repository protocols with mock implementations
- Test zone management service with proper error handling
- Validate CoreData schema with model operations
- End-to-end integration tests with CloudKit
- COPPA compliance validation tests
- Security testing for data access and zone isolation
- Performance testing for sync operations under various network conditions

### CloudKit Testing Notes
- CloudKit Development environment required for testing
- Schema validation must pass before proceeding to Epic 2
- Zone isolation testing critical for child data privacy
- Integration tests must verify all repository operations
- Performance testing for sync operations
