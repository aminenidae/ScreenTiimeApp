# Story 1.5: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure,
**so that** automated testing and deployment can support development throughout all epics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Xcode Cloud CI/CD pipeline configured**
   - Automatic builds triggered on pull requests and main branch commits
   - Build environment configured with proper iOS SDK version (15.0+)
   - Build workflow includes Swift Package Manager dependency resolution
2. **Automated testing pipeline**
   - Unit tests run automatically on every commit
   - UI tests configured (though limited on CI due to Family Controls requiring physical device)
   - Test results reported with pass/fail status and coverage metrics
3. **Code quality automation**
   - SwiftLint integration in CI pipeline
   - SwiftFormat validation
   - Build breaks on critical lint violations
4. **TestFlight deployment pipeline**
   - Automatic TestFlight builds from main branch
   - Beta testing group configured for internal testing
   - Build number auto-increment and version management
5. **App Store Connect integration**
   - App Store Connect app record created
   - Bundle identifiers reserved and configured
   - App metadata placeholders prepared
   - Screenshots and app description templates ready
6. **Environment management**
   - Development vs Production CloudKit environment handling
   - Build configuration management (Debug, Release, TestFlight)
   - Certificate and provisioning profile management via Xcode Cloud
7. **Deployment validation**
   - TestFlight build successfully processes and becomes available
   - Internal testing flow validated
   - App Store Review Guidelines pre-compliance check
