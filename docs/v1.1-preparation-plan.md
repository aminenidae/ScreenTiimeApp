# v1.1 Preparation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the preparation work needed to ensure the architectural foundation is ready for multi-parent collaboration features in v1.1. The plan focuses on verifying existing architecture, identifying gaps, and preparing implementation strategies.

## Current Architectural Foundation

### 1. Data Model Readiness

- CloudKit shared zone architecture
- iCloud Family Sharing integration

#### Child Profile Model
- Child profiles are associated with families
- Point balances and usage data are tracked per child
- CloudKit private zones per child

#### Activity Tracking
- Usage sessions track which user made changes
- Point transactions include user information
- Metadata includes modification tracking

### 2. CloudKit Architecture

## Detailed Implementation Areas

### 1. Parent Coordination Zone

#### CloudKit Implementation
```swift
// Parent coordination zone structure
class ParentCoordinationZone {
    let zoneID: CKRecordZone.ID
    let familyID: String
    
    func createCoordinationEvent(event: ParentCoordinationEvent) -> CKRecord
    func subscribeToCoordinationEvents() -> CKQuerySubscription
    func handleCoordinationEvent(record: CKRecord) -> ParentCoordinationEvent
}
```

#### Data Model
```swift
struct ParentCoordinationEvent {
    let id: String
    let familyID: String
    let userID: String
    let userName: String
    let action: CoordinationAction
    let timestamp: Date
    let details: [String: Any]
    let recordChangeTag: String
}

enum CoordinationAction {
    case appCategorized
    case pointsAdjusted
    case settingsChanged
    case childAdded
    case rewardAllocated
}
```

### 2. Invitation System

#### Token Management
```swift
struct FamilyInvitation {
    let id: String
    let familyID: String
    let invitedByUserID: String
    let invitedByEmail: String
    let createdAt: Date
    let expiresAt: Date
    let token: String
    let status: InvitationStatus
}

enum InvitationStatus {
    case pending
    case accepted
    case expired
    case cancelled
}
```

#### Deep Link Handling
```swift
class InvitationHandler {
    func handleInvitationURL(url: URL) -> Bool
    func validateInvitationToken(token: String) -> InvitationValidationResult
    func acceptInvitation(token: String) async throws -> Family
}
```

### 3. Activity Log System

#### Event Tracking
```swift
struct ActivityEvent {
    let id: String
    let familyID: String
    let userID: String
    let userName: String
    let action: String
    let description: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let beforeValue: String?
    let afterValue: String?
}
```

#### UI Components
```swift
struct ActivityFeedView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: ActivityFeedViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        // Implementation
    }
}

class ActivityFeedViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var events: [ActivityEvent] = []
    @Published var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    func loadEvents(familyID: String) async
    func refreshEvents() async
    func searchEvents(query: String) async
}
```

### 4. Permission Management

#### Role System
```swift
enum ParentRole {
    case owner
    case coParent
    case viewer // For future implementation
}

struct ParentPermission {
    let userID: String
    let role: ParentRole
    let permissions: Set<PermissionType>
}

enum PermissionType {
    case manageSettings
    case categorizeApps
    case adjustPoints
    case addChild
    case removeChild
    case inviteCoParent
    case viewActivityLog
}
```

## Integration Points

- Conflict resolution needs enhanced logic

### 3. Business Logic Integration
