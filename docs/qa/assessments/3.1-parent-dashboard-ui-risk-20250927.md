## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. PERF-001: UI Performance with Many Children

**Description:** The dashboard may become slow or unresponsive when displaying many child profiles with detailed progress information.

**Status:** RESOLVED

**Resolution:**
- Implemented performance monitoring with specific benchmarks
- Added performance targets (<2 seconds for 10 children)
- Integrated memory usage monitoring at key points
- Implemented performance tests with varying numbers of children (5, 10, 20)
- Used LazyVStack for child progress cards
- Optimized progress data calculations with concurrent loading
- Added performance monitoring for dashboard loading times

**Affected Components:**
- ParentDashboardView
- ChildProgressCard
- WeeklyPointsChart

**Detection Method:** Code review and performance testing

**Assessment:**
- Probability: Low (1) - Performance optimizations implemented
- Impact: Low (1) - Benchmarks and monitoring in place
- Residual Risk: Minimal - Performance should be acceptable with current optimizations

### 2. TECH-001: CloudKit Subscription Reliability

**Description:** CloudKit subscriptions may not always deliver real-time updates reliably, leading to stale dashboard data.

**Status:** MONITOR

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Preventive:** Implement robust subscription handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Actions:**
  - Add automatic refresh timers as backup to subscriptions
  - Implement error handling for subscription failures
  - Provide visual indicators for data freshness
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Subscription failure simulation
  - Network connectivity testing
  - Data staleness detection tests
- **Residual Risk:** Low - Multiple update mechanisms should ensure data freshness

**Affected Components:**
- ParentDashboardViewModel
- CloudKitService
- Real-time update mechanisms

**Detection Method:** Integration testing with CloudKit

**Assessment:**
- Probability: Low (1) - CloudKit is generally reliable
- Impact: High (3) - Parents may make decisions based on stale data
- Residual Risk: Low - Multiple update mechanisms should ensure data freshness

### 3. SEC-001: Family Data Privacy in CloudKit Shared Zones

**Description:** Family data stored in CloudKit shared zones could be accessed by unauthorized family members or exposed during sync.

**Status:** RESOLVED

**Resolution:**
- Verified CloudKit shared zone setup with proper permissions
- Confirmed data encryption for sensitive fields
- Added access logging for audit purposes

**Affected Components:**
- CloudKitService
- ChildProfileRepository
- PointTransactionRepository
- UsageSessionRepository

**Detection Method:** Security review and privacy compliance check

**Assessment:**
- Probability: Low (1) - Proper configuration verified
- Impact: Low (1) - Native CloudKit security features provide strong protection
- Residual Risk: Minimal - Native CloudKit security features provide strong protection

### 4. DATA-001: Data Consistency During Real-time Updates

**Description:** Concurrent updates from multiple sources could lead to inconsistent dashboard state or race conditions.

**Status:** MONITOR

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Preventive:** Use proper state management and synchronization
- **Actions:**
  - Ensure all UI updates happen on main thread
  - Use @MainActor for ViewModel methods
  - Implement proper data synchronization patterns
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Concurrent update testing
  - Thread safety verification
  - State consistency validation
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal - SwiftUI's architecture reduces concurrency issues

**Affected Components:**
- ParentDashboardViewModel
- ChildProgressData
- Combine publishers

**Detection Method:** Concurrency testing

**Assessment:**
- Probability: Low (1) - SwiftUI's @MainActor helps prevent many issues
- Impact: Low (1) - Proper synchronization implemented
- Residual Risk: Minimal - SwiftUI's architecture reduces concurrency issues
