# Risk Assessment: Story 2.2 - Point Tracking Engine Implementation

## Overview
This document provides a risk assessment for Story 2.2: Point Tracking Engine Implementation. The assessment evaluates potential risks across technical, operational, and project dimensions.

## Risk Matrix

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| RSK-001 | DeviceActivityMonitor reliability on various iOS versions | Medium | High | 6 | Medium | Comprehensive physical device testing across iOS versions |
| RSK-002 | Point calculation accuracy with edge cases | Medium | Medium | 4 | Medium | Implement comprehensive unit tests for calculation engine |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### RSK-001: DeviceActivityMonitor Reliability
**Description:** The DeviceActivityMonitor framework may behave inconsistently across different iOS versions or device models, potentially leading to inaccurate usage tracking.

**Probability:** Medium - Based on Apple's documentation, DeviceActivityMonitor behavior can vary between iOS versions.

**Impact:** High - Inaccurate usage tracking would directly impact the core functionality of the reward system.

**Mitigation:**
- Perform physical device testing on multiple iOS versions (15.0+)
- Test on various device models
- Implement fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Create comprehensive test scenarios for different usage patterns

### RSK-002: Point Calculation Accuracy
**Description:** The point calculation engine may not handle all edge cases correctly, such as very short usage intervals, app switching scenarios, or device sleep/wake cycles.

**Probability:** Medium - Complex time-based calculations often have edge cases that are difficult to anticipate.

**Impact:** Medium - Incorrect point calculations could lead to user dissatisfaction but wouldn't break the core functionality.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for the calculation engine
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Validate calculations with various time intervals
- Include scenarios for app switching and device state changes

## Risk Summary

- **Critical Risks:** 0
- **High Risks:** 0
- **Medium Risks:** 2
- **Low Risks:** 0

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Complete physical device testing before production deployment
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for point calculation scenarios
   - Document any platform-specific behaviors discovered during testing

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Track DeviceActivityMonitor events in production to identify any inconsistencies
   - Monitor point calculation accuracy through user feedback
   - Review error logs for any calculation or tracking issues

## Conclusion

The overall risk level for Story 2.2 is moderate, with two medium-severity risks identified. Both risks have clear mitigation strategies that should be implemented during development and testing. The story is well-defined and follows established patterns from previous implementations.
