# Risk Assessment - Story 6.2: Real-Time Synchronization

## Overview
This document provides a risk assessment for the real-time synchronization feature implemented in story 6.2.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| RT-001 | Performance | Potential latency issues with real-time sync | Low | Medium | 3 | Debouncing and batching implemented |
| RT-002 | Reliability | Network connectivity issues affecting sync | Medium | High | 6 | Offline queue and retry logic implemented |
| RT-003 | Security | Unauthorized access to coordination events | Low | High | 3 | Private CloudKit database with family-scoped access |
| RT-004 | Data Integrity | Duplicate or conflicting events | Low | Medium | 2 | Idempotent event processing implemented |
| RT-005 | Battery Life | Excessive background processing | Low | Medium | 2 | APNs and efficient delta sync implemented |

## Risk Summary

### Critical Risks (Score 9-10)
None identified

### High Risability Risks (Score 6-8)
- RT-002: Network connectivity issues affecting sync (Score: 6)

### Medium Risks (Score 3-5)
- RT-001: Potential latency issues with real-time sync (Score: 3)
- RT-003: Unauthorized access to coordination events (Score: 3)

### Low Risks (Score 1-2)
- RT-004: Duplicate or conflicting events (Score: 2)
- RT-005: Excessive background processing (Score: 2)

## Risk Recommendations

### Must Fix
None - All critical risks have been properly mitigated

### Monitor
- Network connectivity handling in various environments
- Battery impact during extended usage
- Latency under high load conditions

## Conclusion
The real-time synchronization implementation has appropriate risk mitigations in place. The highest risk (network connectivity) is addressed with offline queue and retry logic. All other risks are low and have been properly addressed through the implementation.
