## Designed By
Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Xcode Cloud CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**Objective**: Verify that the Xcode Cloud CI/CD pipeline is properly configured

**Preconditions**:
- Xcode Cloud project is set up
- Repository is connected to Xcode Cloud
- Required scripts are in place

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new branch with a minor code change
2. Push the changes to trigger a pull request build
3. Merge the pull request to trigger a main branch build
4. Verify that builds are triggered automatically
5. Check build logs for iOS SDK version 15.0+ usage
6. Verify Swift Package Manager dependency resolution

**Expected Results**:
- Builds are triggered automatically on pull requests and main branch commits
- Build environment uses iOS SDK version 15.0+
- Swift Package Manager dependencies are resolved successfully

**Priority**: High

### Test Scenario 2: Automated Testing Pipeline

**Objective**: Verify that automated tests run correctly in the CI/CD pipeline

**Preconditions**:
- CI/CD pipeline is configured
- Test scripts are in place
- Test files exist in the repository

**Test Steps**:
1. Trigger a build through a code commit
2. Monitor the build process
3. Verify that unit tests are executed
4. Check test result reporting
5. Verify code coverage metrics generation
6. Confirm UI test configuration (noting CI limitations)

**Expected Results**:
- Unit tests run automatically on every commit
- Test results are reported with pass/fail status
- Code coverage metrics are generated
- UI tests are configured (with limitations noted)

**Priority**: High

### Test Scenario 3: Code Quality Automation

**Objective**: Verify that code quality checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

**Preconditions**:
- CI/CD pipeline is configured
- SwiftLint and SwiftFormat are available
- Code quality scripts are in place

**Test Steps**:
1. Commit code with critical lint violations
2. Trigger a build
3. Monitor the build process
4. Verify that the build breaks on critical lint violations
5. Check SwiftLint and SwiftFormat execution
6. Confirm proper error reporting

**Expected Results**:
- SwiftLint is integrated into the CI pipeline
- SwiftFormat validation is performed
- Build breaks on critical lint violations
- Proper error reporting for code quality issues

**Priority**: High

### Test Scenario 4: TestFlight Deployment Pipeline

**Objective**: Verify that TestFlight deployment is properly configured

**Preconditions**:
- Deployment pipeline is configured
- App Store Connect integration is set up
- Beta testing group exists

**Test Steps**:
1. Merge changes to the main branch
2. Monitor the deployment process
3. Verify automatic TestFlight build creation
4. Check beta testing group configuration
5. Verify build number auto-increment
6. Confirm version management workflow

**Expected Results**:
- Automatic TestFlight builds are created from main branch
- Beta testing group is properly configured
- Build number auto-increments with each deployment
- Version management workflow functions correctly

**Priority**: High

### Test Scenario 5: App Store Connect Integration

**Objective**: Verify App Store Connect integration is properly configured

**Preconditions**:
- App Store Connect account is available
- App record configuration exists
- Metadata files are in place

**Test Steps**:
1. Review `.appstore/config.json` configuration
2. Verify App Store Connect app record creation
3. Check bundle identifier configuration
4. Review app metadata placeholders
5. Verify screenshot and description templates

**Expected Results**:
- App Store Connect app record is created
- Bundle identifiers are reserved and configured
- App metadata placeholders are prepared
- Screenshots and description templates are ready

**Priority**: Medium

### Test Scenario 6: Environment Management

**Objective**: Verify environment management for different deployment targets

**Preconditions**:
- Environment configuration files exist
- Build configurations are set up
- Xcode Cloud project is configured

**Test Steps**:
1. Review Development, Staging, TestFlight, and Production plist files
2. Verify CloudKit environment handling
3. Check build configuration management
4. Confirm certificate and provisioning profile management

**Expected Results**:
- Development vs Production CloudKit environment handling is implemented
- Build configuration management is in place
- Certificate and provisioning profile management is configured via Xcode Cloud

**Priority**: Medium

### Test Scenario 7: Deployment Validation

**Objective**: Verify deployment validation processes

**Preconditions**:
- Deployment validation scripts exist
- TestFlight deployment is configured
- App Store Connect integration is set up

**Test Steps**:
1. Run `deployment-validation.sh` script
2. Verify TestFlight build processing
3. Validate internal testing flow
4. Execute App Store Review Guidelines pre-compliance check
5. Review deployment validation report

**Expected Results**:
- TestFlight build successfully processes and becomes available
- Internal testing flow is validated
- App Store Review Guidelines pre-compliance check is executed
- Deployment validation results are documented

**Priority**: High

## Test Data Requirements

- Sample code changes for triggering builds
- Test accounts for App Store Connect
- Beta tester accounts for TestFlight validation
- Sample metadata for app store listing

## Test Environment

- Xcode Cloud environment
- App Store Connect account
- TestFlight beta testing group
- Development, Staging, TestFlight, and Production environments

## Test Tools

- Xcode Cloud for CI/CD
- SwiftLint for code quality checks
- SwiftFormat for code formatting validation
- Shell scripts for automation
- jq for JSON processing in scripts

## Risk Considerations

1. **Security**: Ensure App Store Connect credentials are handled securely
2. **Performance**: Monitor build times to ensure they remain reasonable
3. **Reliability**: Verify error handling in all scripts
4. **Maintainability**: Ensure scripts are well-documented and maintainable

## Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria**:
- Xcode Cloud project is set up
- Repository is connected to Xcode Cloud
- Required scripts are committed to the repository

**Exit Criteria**:
- All test scenarios pass
- Deployment validation is successful
- Documentation is complete
- No critical or high severity issues remain

## Defect Classification

- **Critical**: Issues that prevent deployment or break the build process
- **High**: Issues that affect core functionality or security
- **Medium**: Issues that affect usability or maintainability
- **Low**: Minor issues or suggestions for improvement

## Test Execution Schedule

- Initial validation: Upon completion of implementation
- Ongoing validation: With each significant code change
- Periodic review: Monthly or as needed based on changes
