## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Revenue Protection - Paywall Enforcement
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Core subscription model depends on proper paywall enforcement
**Impact**: High - Direct revenue loss if premium features are accessible without payment
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive testing of all paywall trigger points
- Add integration tests for all subscription tiers and edge cases
- Perform security testing to ensure no bypass mechanisms exist
- Implement monitoring for unauthorized premium feature access
**Testing Focus**: Security testing, integration testing, edge case validation

## High Risks

### 1. PERF-001: Performance Impact of Feature Gating
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Feature gate checks add overhead to UI interactions
**Impact**: High - Poor user experience if gating causes UI lag
**Mitigation**:
- Implement caching for subscription status (already done in FeatureGateService)
- Use async/await patterns to prevent UI blocking
- Monitor performance metrics in production
**Testing Focus**: Performance testing, load testing

### 2. DATA-001: Data Loss on Subscription Expiry
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Low - Graceful degradation is implemented but complex
**Impact**: High - User data loss would be catastrophic
**Mitigation**:
- Ensure read-only access is properly implemented for expired subscriptions
- Test offline scenarios with expired subscriptions
- Verify no data deletion occurs on subscription lapse
**Testing Focus**: Integration testing, offline scenario testing

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-001: UI Consistency in Feature Gating
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Different UI components may not consistently apply gating
**Impact**: Medium - Inconsistent user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Use standardized view modifiers for feature gating
- Implement design system components for locked features
- Create comprehensive UI tests
**Testing Focus**: UI testing, visual regression testing

### 2. TECH-002: Child Count Validation Accuracy
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Placeholder implementation exists in getChildCount method
**Impact**: Medium - Incorrect child limit enforcement could affect revenue
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper child count retrieval from repository
- Add integration tests for child count validation
- Monitor for discrepancies in production
**Testing Focus**: Integration testing, data validation testing

### 3. TECH-003: Cache Invalidation Issues
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Caching is implemented but complex scenarios may cause issues
**Impact**: Medium - Users may see incorrect access status
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper cache invalidation when entitlement changes
- Add cache expiration mechanism (already partially implemented)
- Test cache behavior in various scenarios
**Testing Focus**: Integration testing, edge case testing

## Low Risks

### 1. OPS-001: Monitoring and Alerting
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Basic monitoring can be implemented
**Impact**: Low - Operational inconvenience
**Mitigation**:
- Implement logging for feature access attempts
- Add monitoring for paywall triggers
- Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
**Testing Focus**: Monitoring validation

### 2. TECH-004: Backward Compatibility
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Legacy methods exist for compatibility
**Impact**: Low - Minor code maintenance
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain legacy methods with deprecation warnings
- Provide migration path for existing code
- Test backward compatibility
**Testing Focus**: Regression testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for paywall enforcement
- Integration tests for all subscription tiers
- Edge case validation for subscription status transitions
- Manual penetration testing of feature access points

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing of feature gate service
- Integration testing for expired subscription handling
- Offline scenario testing with expired subscriptions
- Load testing with concurrent feature access checks

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- UI consistency testing across components
- Cache behavior testing in various scenarios
- Backward compatibility testing
- Monitoring and alerting validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (SEC-001)
- High risks affecting security/data (PERF-001, DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls

- Error rates for subscription validation failures
- Paywall trigger frequency and conversion rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New subscription tiers are added
- Additional premium features are implemented
