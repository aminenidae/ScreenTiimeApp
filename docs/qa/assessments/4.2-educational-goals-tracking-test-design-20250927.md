   - Badge criteria (4.2-UNIT-005)
   - Notification scheduling (4.2-UNIT-012)
   - Goal limit enforcement (4.2-UNIT-015)

2. **P0 Integration tests**
   - Progress updates from sessions (4.2-INT-001)
   - Notification triggers (4.2-INT-007)

3. **P1 Tests in order**
   - Remaining unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for UI components
   - E2E tests for user journeys

4. **P2+ Tests as time permits**
   - Edge cases and secondary features
   - Performance and scalability tests

## Test Environment Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Swift Testing framework
- Mock repositories for data isolation
- Fixed date/time for consistent calculations

## Success Criteria

- All P0 tests must pass (100% success rate)
- P1 tests achieve >95% success rate
- Test execution completes within 10 minutes for full suite
- No flaky tests (tests must be deterministic)
- Test coverage reports indicate >90% code coverage for goal tracking logic
