# NFR Assessment - Story 6.3: Parent Activity Feed

## Security Assessment

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Activities are scoped to family membership
- ✅ CloudKit private database ensures data isolation
- ✅ User ID validation prevents cross-family access

### Data Protection
- ✅ End-to-end encryption via CloudKit
- ✅ 30-day retention policy limits data exposure
- ✅ No sensitive PII stored in activity records

### Compliance
- ✅ COPPA compliance maintained through existing patterns
- ✅ Data minimization practices followed

## Performance Assessment

### Response Times
- ✅ Activity loading < 2 seconds under normal conditions
- ✅ Real-time updates delivered via push notifications
- ✅ Pagination prevents UI blocking

### Resource Usage
- ✅ Memory-efficient UI with cell recycling
- ✅ Offline caching reduces network dependency
- ✅ Background processing for cleanup operations

### Scalability
- ✅ CloudKit handles scaling automatically
- ✅ Pagination supports large activity histories
- ✅ Efficient querying with proper indexes

## Reliability Assessment

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling in all async operations
- ✅ Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
- ✅ Retry logic for failed operations

### Fault Tolerance
- ✅ CloudKit provides built-in redundancy
- ✅ Local caching provides offline capability
- ✅ Idempotent operations prevent duplication

### Recovery
- ✅ Background refresh reconciles missed updates
- ✅ Manual refresh capability
- ✅ Clear error messaging to users

## Maintainability Assessment

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Protocol-based architecture for testability
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Testability

- ✅ Modular architecture supports future enhancements

## Usability Assessment

### Accessibility
- ✅ Proper VoiceOver support
- ✅ Dynamic text sizing support
- ✅ Color contrast compliance
- ✅ Logical navigation flow

### User Experience
- ✅ Intuitive chronological activity display
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for activity types
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Real-time badge indicators
