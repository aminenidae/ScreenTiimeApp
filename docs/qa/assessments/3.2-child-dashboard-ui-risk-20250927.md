## Detailed Risk Register

### 1. PERF-001: Animation performance on older devices

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Animations may perform poorly on older devices with limited resources
**Impact**: Medium - Could result in a degraded user experience for some children
**Affected Components**:
- FloatingPointsNotificationView
- ProgressRingView
- PointsBalanceView

**Mitigation**:
- Test animations on a range of devices including older models
- Implement performance monitoring for animation frame rates
- Consider reducing animation complexity for lower-end devices
- Add device capability detection to adjust animations dynamically

**Testing Focus**: 
- Performance testing on iPhone SE and other lower-end devices
- Frame rate monitoring during animation sequences
- Memory usage tracking during animated interactions

### 2. TECH-001: Real-time updates reliability with CloudKit

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Network issues or CloudKit service interruptions could affect real-time updates
**Impact**: Medium - Children may not see immediate point updates, reducing engagement
**Affected Components**:
- ChildDashboardViewModel
- CloudKit subscriptions

**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust error handling for CloudKit subscription failures
- Add retry mechanisms for failed updates
- Provide visual feedback when updates are pending
- Implement local caching with conflict resolution

**Testing Focus**:
- Network connectivity testing with various connection types
- CloudKit subscription failure simulation
- Offline mode functionality verification
- Data synchronization testing after connectivity restoration

### 3. DATA-001: Point balance accuracy in concurrent scenarios

**Score: 1 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Concurrent point updates are unlikely in typical usage
**Impact**: Low - Minor point discrepancies that would be corrected on next sync
**Affected Components**:
- ChildDashboardViewModel
- PointTransaction processing

**Mitigation**:
- Use atomic operations for point balance updates
- Implement proper conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Add validation checks for point balance consistency

**Testing Focus**:
- Concurrent point earning scenario testing
- Point balance validation after multiple simultaneous updates
- Conflict resolution verification

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- Performance testing on older iOS devices
- Network reliability testing for CloudKit subscriptions
- Concurrent point update scenario validation

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- Point balance accuracy verification
- Conflict resolution testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All animation performance issues that significantly degrade UX
- Critical CloudKit subscription failures

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Minor animation performance variations
- Non-critical CloudKit issues with proper error handling

### Accepted Risks

- Minor point balance discrepancies in edge cases (low probability, low impact)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Animation frame rates on various devices
- CloudKit subscription success/failure rates
- Point balance discrepancy reports

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New animation features are added
- CloudKit integration is modified
- Performance issues are reported by users
