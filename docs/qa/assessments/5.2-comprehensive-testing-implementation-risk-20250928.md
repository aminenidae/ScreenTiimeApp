# Risk Profile: Story 5.2

Date: 2025-09-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 80/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - all risks are at medium or lower levels.

## High Risks

### 1. [PERF-001]: Performance Testing Environment May Not Reflect Production

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Testing on limited device set
**Impact**: High - Performance issues may only appear in production
**Mitigation**:

- Expand testing to more device models and OS versions
- Implement ongoing performance monitoring in production
- Create performance regression tests in CI/CD pipeline

**Testing Focus**: Performance testing on a wider variety of devices and network conditions

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category | Description                                      | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001 | PERF     | Limited performance testing environment          | Medium (2)  | High (3)| 6    | High     |
| DATA-001 | DATA     | Test data may not represent production scenarios | Low (1)     | Low (1) | 1    | Low      |
| BUS-001  | BUS      | Test coverage may miss edge user workflows       | Low (1)     | Low (2) | 2    | Low      |
| OPS-001  | OPS      | CI/CD pipeline tests may not catch all issues    | Low (1)     | Low (1) | 1    | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing on additional device models
- Network condition testing (slow connections, intermittent connectivity)
- Stress testing with concurrent user scenarios

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Edge case testing with unusual user workflows
- Data validation with boundary values
- Integration testing with various API response times

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Regression test suite
- Accessibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Performance testing expanded to cover more device types
- CI/CD pipeline enhanced with additional validation steps

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Ongoing performance monitoring implemented
- User feedback mechanisms established

### Accepted Risks

- Limited device testing environment (acknowledged risk for MVP)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics across different device types
- User feedback on app responsiveness
- Battery usage reports from production users
- Crash reports related to performance issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New device types are targeted
- Performance issues are reported in production
- New testing capabilities are added
- User feedback indicates performance problems
