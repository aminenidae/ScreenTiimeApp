## Risk Summary

| Risk Category | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Critical      | 0     |
| High          | 0     |
| Medium        | 1     |
| Low           | 1     |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Performance Issues**
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Description**: Missing caching for app icons could impact performance when dealing with a large number of apps.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching for app icons to improve performance.

### Low Priority Risks

1. **TODO Comments**
   - **Probability**: Low
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Description**: There were TODO comments in the code that have now been addressed.
   - **Mitigation**: Addressed all TODO comments in the code.

## Risk Score Calculation

Based on the risk assessment:
- High risks: 0
- Medium risks: 1
- Low risks: 1

Risk Score = 100 - (20 × High) - (10 × Medium) - (1 × Low)
Risk Score = 100 - (20 × 0) - (10 × 1) - (1 × 1) = 100 - 0 - 10 - 1 = 89

## Recommendations

1. **Near-term Actions** (Should address in current sprint):
   - Implement caching for app icons to improve performance

2. **Future Actions** (Can address later):
   - Continue monitoring performance as more apps are added
