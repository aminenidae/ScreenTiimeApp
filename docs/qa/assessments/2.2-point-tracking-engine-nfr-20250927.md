# NFR Assessment: 2.2

Date: 2025-09-27
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Proper authentication and authorization implemented
- Performance: CONCERNS - Battery impact monitoring needed
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Data persistence validation incomplete
- Maintainability: PASS - Good test coverage and modular design

## Critical Issues

1. **Battery Impact Monitoring** (Performance)
   - Risk: Continuous tracking may affect battery life
   - Fix: Implement battery usage monitoring and optimization strategies

2. **Data Persistence Validation** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Incomplete integration testing for data persistence
   - Fix: Complete end-to-end integration tests for data persistence

## Quick Wins

- Add battery impact monitoring: ~2 hours
- Complete integration testing: ~4 hours
- Implement performance profiling: ~1 hour

## NFR Validation Details

### Security

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** The story properly integrates with DeviceActivityMonitor through Family Controls framework, which requires proper user consent. CloudKit integration follows secure practices with end-to-end encryption. No hardcoded credentials or security vulnerabilities identified.

### Performance

**Status: CONCERNS**
**Notes:** The story implements continuous background tracking which could impact battery life. While the DeviceActivityMonitor framework is designed to be efficient, actual battery impact needs to be measured and monitored. No specific performance targets for battery impact are defined.

### Reliability

**Status: CONCERNS**
**Notes:** The story includes data persistence with CloudKit and local CoreData caching. However, the integration testing task is not yet complete, which is critical for ensuring reliability. Edge case handling is implemented but needs validation through comprehensive testing.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** The implementation follows good modular design with separate services for tracking and calculation. Comprehensive unit tests are included. Code follows established patterns from previous stories. Good documentation and clear file structure.
