  - When: Data changes occur
  - Then: Publishers emit updates correctly

- **Integration Test**: `ParentDashboardRequirementsValidationTests.testAC4_RealTimeUpdates`
  - Given: ViewModel with subscription setup
  - When: Data changes and updates are simulated
  - Then: UI receives reactive updates via Combine publishers

- **Integration Test**: `ParentDashboardIntegrationTests.testDataLoadingAndRealTimeUpdates`
  - Given: ViewModel with real repositories
  - When: Data is loaded and updated
  - Then: Updates are received via publishers

#### AC5: Pull-to-refresh

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ParentDashboardViewModelTests.testRefreshData_CallsLoadInitialData`
  - Given: ViewModel with data
  - When: Refresh data is called
  - Then: Load initial data is invoked

- **Integration Test**: `ParentDashboardRequirementsValidationTests.testAC5_PullToRefresh`
  - Given: ViewModel with data
  - When: Pull-to-refresh is performed
  - Then: Data is refreshed and timestamp is updated

- **UI Test**: `ParentDashboardView` refreshable modifier
  - Given: Dashboard view with refreshable modifier
  - When: Pull-to-refresh gesture is performed
  - Then: Refresh function is called

#### AC6: Empty state UI

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ParentDashboardViewModelTests.testLoadInitialData_WithNoChildren_LoadsEmptyList`
  - Given: Repository with no children
  - When: Initial data is loaded
  - Then: Empty children list is returned

- **Integration Test**: `ParentDashboardRequirementsValidationTests.testAC6_EmptyStateUI`
  - Given: ViewModel with no children
  - When: Dashboard is displayed
  - Then: Empty state UI is shown with appropriate messaging

- **UI Test**: `ParentDashboardView` empty state preview
  - Given: Dashboard view with no children
  - When: View is rendered
  - Then: Empty state UI is displayed with call-to-action button

### Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have full test coverage at multiple levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive coverage analysis, the current test suite is well-structured and provides good coverage. However, the following enhancements could be considered:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Add specific performance benchmarks
   - Implement tests with large numbers of children (10+, 50+)
   - Add memory usage monitoring

2. **Security Testing**
   - Add specific privacy compliance tests
   - Implement access control validation tests
   - Add data encryption verification tests

3. **Concurrency Testing**
   - Add more extensive concurrency testing for real-time updates
   - Implement race condition testing
   - Add stress testing for high-frequency updates

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All requirements have full coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Performance with many children - addressed by existing tests but could be enhanced
- **Low Risk**: Data consistency during updates - well covered by existing tests
