Date: 2025-09-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 65/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: DeviceActivityMonitor Integration Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - DeviceActivityMonitor has complex lifecycle management and requires careful integration with the app's lifecycle
**Impact**: High - If not properly integrated, tracking may fail completely or consume excessive battery
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive lifecycle management for DeviceActivityMonitor
- Add proper error handling for all DeviceActivityMonitor operations
- Create unit tests for all lifecycle scenarios
  **Testing Focus**: Integration testing with physical devices, lifecycle management testing

### 2. [DATA-001]: Data Loss Potential in Point Tracking

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: Medium - Network issues or app crashes during tracking could result in lost point data
**Impact**: High - Children could lose earned points, leading to user frustration and trust issues
**Mitigation**:

- Implement local caching with CoreData for offline-first operations
- Add transactional consistency for point awards
- Create integration tests for data persistence scenarios
  **Testing Focus**: Offline operation testing, crash recovery testing, data consistency validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Test DeviceActivityMonitor integration with app lifecycle management
- Validate data persistence and recovery mechanisms
- Test offline operation scenarios
- Verify crash recovery for point tracking

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Validate point calculation accuracy with various time intervals
- Test battery impact under continuous tracking
- Verify sync behavior in multi-device scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Test privacy compliance in usage tracking
- Validate business logic for point awards
- Test debugging capabilities for complex scenarios

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- DeviceActivityMonitor integration issues
- Data loss prevention mechanisms

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Minor debugging complexity issues can be addressed post-deployment

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Battery usage metrics for tracking functionality
- Error rates in point calculation and awarding
- Data sync success rates across devices
- User feedback on point tracking accuracy

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly
- New integrations added
- Performance issues reported
- User feedback indicates tracking problems
