## Story: 4.4 - Notifications Progress Tracking

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 6
- Fully Covered: 6 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Notification system is implemented for key events with reliable delivery

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationSuccess`
  - Given: A child profile and valid notification preferences
  - When: A notification is scheduled for a points earned event
  - Then: The notification is properly created and added to the notification center

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationWhenGloballyDisabled`
  - Given: A child profile with notifications globally disabled
  - When: A notification is scheduled
  - Then: No notification is added to the notification center

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationWhenEventTypeDisabled`
  - Given: A child profile with specific notification types disabled
  - When: A disabled notification type is scheduled
  - Then: No notification is added to the notification center

- **Integration Test**: `NotificationIntegrationTests.testCompleteNotificationFlow`
  - Given: A complete notification setup with authorization and preferences
  - When: Multiple notification types are scheduled
  - Then: Notifications are properly delivered and managed

#### AC2: Parents can customize notification preferences with granular control over event types

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationSettingsViewModelTests.testEnableNotificationType`
  - Given: Notification settings view model with no enabled notifications
  - When: A specific notification type is enabled
  - Then: The notification type is added to the enabled set and preferences are saved

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationSettingsViewModelTests.testDisableNotificationType`
  - Given: Notification settings view model with all notifications enabled
  - When: A specific notification type is disabled
  - Then: The notification type is removed from the enabled set and preferences are saved

- **UI Test**: `NotificationSettingsUITests.testNotificationSettingsView`
  - Given: The notification settings view
  - When: Notification type toggles are interacted with
  - Then: The toggles respond correctly and save preferences

#### AC3: Notifications are timely and relevant based on child's learning activity

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationSuccess`
  - Given: A child profile and valid notification preferences
  - When: A notification is scheduled with relevant payload data
  - Then: The notification content accurately reflects the child's learning activity

#### AC4: Notification frequency is reasonable with batching to avoid annoyance (max 3 notifications per day)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testCooldownPeriodEnforcement`
  - Given: A child profile with a recent notification sent
  - When: Another notification is scheduled within the cooldown period
  - Then: No notification is scheduled due to cooldown enforcement

#### AC5: Notifications respect quiet hours (8 PM - 8 AM) by default

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationWithinQuietHours`
  - Given: A child profile with quiet hours that include the current time
  - When: A notification is scheduled
  - Then: No notification is scheduled due to quiet hours enforcement

- **Integration Test**: `NotificationIntegrationTests.testQuietHoursEnforcement`
  - Given: A complete notification setup with quiet hours
  - When: A notification is scheduled during quiet hours
  - Then: No notification is delivered

#### AC6: Parents can opt out of all notifications with one setting

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationServiceTests.testScheduleNotificationWhenGloballyDisabled`
  - Given: A child profile with all notifications disabled
  - When: Any notification is scheduled
  - Then: No notification is scheduled due to global disable

- **Unit Test**: `NotificationSettingsViewModelTests.testUpdateNotificationsEnabled`
  - Given: Notification settings view model
  - When: The global notifications enabled setting is toggled
  - Then: The setting is updated and preferences are saved

### Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the test coverage is comprehensive. However, here are some additional recommendations:

1. **Additional Performance Tests**
   - Add load testing scenarios with high volumes of concurrent notifications
   - Implement performance monitoring for notification scheduling operations

2. **Additional Security Tests**
   - Add tests for notification payload sanitization
   - Implement security scanning for potential data exposure

3. **Additional Edge Case Tests**
   - Add tests for timezone changes during quiet hours
   - Add tests for notification delivery during device state changes

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All requirements have full coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Notification performance under load - addressed by recommended performance tests
- **Low Risk**: UI responsiveness with rapid interactions - addressed by recommended UI tests
