# Risk Assessment: Story 6.4 - Permissions & Access Control

## Overview
This document provides a risk assessment for the Permissions & Access Control feature implementation. The assessment evaluates potential security, performance, and operational risks associated with the new permission system.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| SEC-001 | Security | Unauthorized access to family data | Low | High | 6 | Permission checks at service and repository layers |
| SEC-002 | Security | Privilege escalation | Low | High | 6 | Owner-only role assignment and user removal |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Slow permission checking | Low | Medium | 4 | Efficient role lookup in Family model |
| REL-001 | Reliability | Permission service failure | Low | Medium | 4 | Error handling for family not found scenarios |
| OPER-001 | Operational | Complex permission model confusion | Medium | Low | 3 | Clear UI indicators and role badges |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Security Risks

**SEC-001: Unauthorized access to family data**
- **Description**: Risk of users accessing family data they shouldn't have access to
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Permission checks implemented at service layer (PermissionService)
  - Repository operations wrapped with permission checks (PermissionAwareRepositoryService)
  - UI components with permission-aware controls
  - Comprehensive test coverage for permission scenarios

**SEC-002: Privilege escalation**
- **Description**: Risk of non-owners assigning roles or removing users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Role assignment and user removal restricted to family owners
  - Proper validation in PermissionService
  - Test coverage for unauthorized role management attempts

### Performance Risks

**PERF-001: Slow permission checking**
- **Description**: Potential performance impact from frequent permission checks
- **Mitigation**:
  - Efficient role lookup directly from Family model
  - Minimal overhead in permission checking logic
  - No complex computations in permission validation

### Reliability Risks

**REL-001: Permission service failure**
- **Description**: Risk of permission service failing when family data is unavailable
- **Mitigation**:
  - Proper error handling for family not found scenarios
  - Clear error messages for unauthorized actions
  - Graceful degradation when permission checks fail

### Operational Risks

**OPER-001: Complex permission model confusion**
- **Description**: Users may be confused by the permission model
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear UI indicators with role badges
  - Explicit labeling of owner vs co-parent vs viewer roles
  - Unauthorized action alerts with clear messaging

## Risk Summary

- **Critical Risks**: 0
- **High Risks**: 0
- **Medium Risks**: 2 (SEC-001, SEC-002)
- **Low Risks**: 3 (PERF-001, REL-001, OPER-001)

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor**: Track unauthorized access attempts in production
2. **Monitor**: Review permission-related error logs for unexpected failures
3. **Consider**: Implement audit logging for permission changes in future iterations
4. **Consider**: Add performance monitoring for high-volume permission check scenarios

## Risk Rating
**Overall Risk Level**: LOW

The implementation has been carefully designed with appropriate security controls and has comprehensive test coverage. The risk level is low, and the feature is ready for production use.
