## Detailed Risk Register

### 1. [SEC-001]: Notification Payload Data Exposure

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Possible in development scenarios
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential exposure of user data
**Description**: Notification payloads may contain sensitive user information that could be exposed if notifications are not properly secured.
**Affected Components**: NotificationService
**Mitigation**: 
- Ensure all notification payloads are sanitized before display
- Implement proper data validation for notification content
- Review all payload data to ensure no sensitive information is included
**Testing Focus**: Security testing of notification payloads, review of notification content

### 2. [PERF-001]: Notification Scheduling Performance

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Possible with many concurrent notifications
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential performance degradation
**Description**: The notification scheduling system may experience performance issues when scheduling many notifications concurrently.
**Affected Components**: NotificationService
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement proper batching for notification scheduling
- Add performance monitoring for notification operations
- Optimize the quiet hours calculation algorithm
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with multiple concurrent notifications, performance profiling

### 3. [OPS-001]: Notification Delivery Reliability

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Possible in various device states
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential missed notifications
**Description**: Notifications may not be delivered reliably in certain device states (background, low power mode, etc.).
**Affected Components**: NotificationService, System Integration
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement proper error handling for notification delivery failures
- Add logging for notification delivery attempts
- Consider implementing fallback mechanisms for critical notifications
**Testing Focus**: Testing notification delivery in various device states, error handling scenarios

### 4. [TECH-001]: UI Responsiveness with Many Toggles

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Unlikely with current implementation
**Impact**: Low (2) - Minor UI responsiveness issues
**Description**: The NotificationSettingsView may experience minor responsiveness issues when toggling many notification types rapidly.
**Affected Components**: NotificationSettingsView
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement debouncing for preference saving operations
- Optimize the UI update logic for better responsiveness
**Testing Focus**: UI responsiveness testing with rapid toggle operations

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- Test notification payload sanitization
- Test notification scheduling performance with concurrent operations
- Test notification delivery in various device states

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- Test UI responsiveness with rapid toggle operations
- Test edge cases in quiet hours calculation

### Priority 3: Standard Functional Tests

- Test all standard notification functionality
- Test all preference saving and loading scenarios

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All medium risks with available mitigations should be addressed

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks can be monitored post-deployment

### Accepted Risks

- No risks are being accepted at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for notification scheduling
- Error rates for notification delivery
- User feedback on notification relevance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New notification types are added
- Notification delivery mechanisms change
- Performance issues are reported
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
