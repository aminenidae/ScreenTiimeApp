- Risk Score: 78/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks identified.

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [DATA-001]: Data Loss Potential in CloudKit Operations

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - CloudKit operations can fail due to network issues or conflicts
**Impact**: High (3) - Potential data loss or corruption if not properly handled
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive error handling for all CloudKit operations
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Implement proper conflict resolution strategies
- Add offline support with local queuing

**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for error scenarios and offline handling

### 2. [SEC-001]: Security Vulnerabilities in Data Access

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Improper access controls could expose data
**Impact**: High (3) - Unauthorized access to family/child data violates privacy
**Mitigation**:

- Implement proper zone isolation for child data
- Add authentication checks for all data operations
- Validate all inputs before saving to CloudKit
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

**Testing Focus**: Security testing with various permission scenarios

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Test CloudKit error handling and retry mechanisms
- Validate zone isolation for child data
- Test authentication and authorization for data access
- Verify conflict resolution scenarios

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Performance testing for sync operations under various network conditions
- Offline operation testing with local queuing
- Zone management service testing with error scenarios
- Data consistency validation across devices

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- COPPA compliance validation tests
- Data migration scenario tests
- Testing in CloudKit Development environment

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All security vulnerabilities (SEC-001)
- Critical data loss prevention (DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance optimizations (PERF-001) with monitoring
- Offline operation improvements (DATA-002) with user guidance
- Zone management complexity (TECH-001) with documentation

### Accepted Risks

- COPPA compliance (BUS-001) - Will be validated by legal team
- Testing complexity (OPS-001) - Will use mock environments where possible

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Error rates for CloudKit operations
- Sync performance metrics
- Security audit logs
- Data consistency checks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- CloudKit schema changes significantly
- New security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Performance issues are reported in production
- COPPA regulations change
