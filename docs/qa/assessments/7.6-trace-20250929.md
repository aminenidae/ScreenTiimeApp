### Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have appropriate test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the implementation review, here are additional recommendations:

1. **Add Unit Tests for Existing Services**
   - Create FeatureGateServiceTests.swift with comprehensive unit tests
   - Create PaywallTriggerServiceTests.swift with comprehensive unit tests
   - Add tests for edge cases and error conditions

2. **Add UI Tests for Feature Gating Components**
   - Create FeatureGatingUITests.swift for UI component testing
   - Create PaywallUITests.swift for paywall interface testing
   - Add visual regression tests for consistent UI

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Add performance tests for feature gate service
   - Test cache behavior under load
   - Validate UI responsiveness with gating enabled

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage - None identified
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with only partial coverage - None identified
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full unit + integration coverage - All requirements
