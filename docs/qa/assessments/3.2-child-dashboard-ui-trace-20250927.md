### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Child dashboard displays a progress ring showing daily point goal completion (e.g., 45/100 points)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ProgressRingViewTests.swift::testProgressRingDisplaysCorrectValues`
  - Given: A ProgressRingView with specific progress values
  - When: The view is rendered
  - Then: The progress ring displays the correct percentage and point values

- **Integration Test**: `ChildDashboardIntegrationTests.swift::testProgressRingUpdatesWithPointChanges`
  - Given: A child dashboard with changing point balances
  - When: Point balance updates occur
  - Then: The progress ring updates to reflect the new values

#### AC2: Points balance is prominently displayed with large, colorful numbers

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `PointsBalanceViewTests.swift::testPointsBalanceDisplaysLargeNumbers`
  - Given: A PointsBalanceView with a specific point value
  - When: The view is rendered
  - Then: The point value is displayed in large, colorful text

- **Integration Test**: `ChildDashboardIntegrationTests.swift::testPointsBalanceUpdatesInRealTime`
  - Given: A child dashboard with changing point balances
  - When: Point balance updates occur
  - Then: The points balance view updates immediately with the new value

#### AC3: Reward cards show available rewards with point costs and visual previews

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `RewardCardViewTests.swift::testRewardCardDisplaysCorrectInformation`
  - Given: A RewardCardView with reward data
  - When: The view is rendered
  - Then: The reward name, point cost, and visual preview are displayed correctly

- **Integration Test**: `ChildDashboardIntegrationTests.swift::testRewardCardsDisplayAvailableRewards`
  - Given: A child dashboard with available rewards
  - When: The dashboard loads reward data
  - Then: Reward cards are displayed for each available reward

#### AC4: Visual feedback animations play when points are earned (floating "+5" notifications)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `FloatingPointsNotificationViewTests.swift::testFloatingNotificationAnimation`
  - Given: A FloatingPointsNotificationView
  - When: The view is triggered to show a point notification
  - Then: The notification floats upward and fades out with animation

- **Integration Test**: `ChildDashboardIntegrationTests.swift::testFloatingNotificationsAppearWhenPointsEarned`
  - Given: A child dashboard during point earning
  - When: Points are earned through app usage
  - Then: Floating point notifications appear with the correct point values

#### AC5: Interface uses large touch targets and simple navigation suitable for children ages 6-12

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ChildDashboardViewTests.swift::testTouchTargetsMeetMinimumSize`
  - Given: A ChildDashboardView with interactive elements
  - When: The view is analyzed for touch target sizes
  - Then: All interactive elements are at least 44pt in size

- **Accessibility Test**: `ChildDashboardAccessibilityTests.swift::testAccessibilityLabelsAndTraits`
  - Given: A child dashboard with UI elements
  - When: Accessibility features are evaluated
  - Then: All elements have appropriate accessibility labels and traits

#### AC6: Dashboard updates in real-time when points are earned or rewards are redeemed

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `ChildDashboardIntegrationTests.swift::testRealTimeUpdatesWithCloudKitSubscriptions`
  - Given: A child dashboard with CloudKit subscriptions
  - When: Point balances change in CloudKit
  - Then: The dashboard updates in real-time to reflect the changes

- **ViewModel Test**: `ChildDashboardViewModelTests.swift::testCombinePublishersForRealTimeUpdates`
  - Given: A ChildDashboardViewModel with CloudKit publishers
  - When: Data changes occur in the underlying repositories
  - Then: The ViewModel publishes updates to the UI

### Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage at multiple levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

All requirements are well-covered with appropriate test types:
- Unit tests for individual component behavior
- Integration tests for component interaction
- ViewModel tests for business logic
- Accessibility tests for usability requirements

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All requirements fully covered
- **Medium Risk**: None - Test coverage is comprehensive
- **Low Risk**: None - Implementation quality is high

The traceability matrix shows complete coverage of all acceptance criteria with appropriate test types at each level.
