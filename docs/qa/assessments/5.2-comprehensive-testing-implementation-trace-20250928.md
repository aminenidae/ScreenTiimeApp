### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

All requirements have been fully addressed with appropriate test coverage at multiple levels:
1. Unit tests for individual component validation
2. Integration tests for component interaction verification
3. End-to-end tests for user experience validation
4. Performance tests for system resource impact validation

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All requirements fully covered
- **Medium Risk**: None - Comprehensive testing implemented
- **Low Risk**: None - All acceptance criteria validated
