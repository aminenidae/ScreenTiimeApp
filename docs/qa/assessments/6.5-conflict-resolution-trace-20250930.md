# Requirements Traceability - Story 6.5: Conflict Resolution

## Trace Date: 2025-09-30
## Traced By: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Acceptance Criteria to Test Mapping

### AC 1: Conflict Detection
**As a parent, I want the app to handle conflicts when multiple parents make changes simultaneously, so that no one's changes are lost.**

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: ConflictDetectorTests.testDetectConflictWithinTimeWindow
- Unit Tests: ConflictDetectorTests.testDetectConflictOutsideTimeWindow
- Unit Tests: ConflictDetectorTests.testDetectFamilyConflict
- Unit Tests: ConflictDetectorTests.testDetectChildProfileConflict
- Integration Tests: CloudKitConflictHandlerTests.testHandleConflictsWithRecords

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given multiple parents edit the same family record simultaneously
  When the conflict detection service runs
  Then it identifies the conflict and triggers resolution

- Given a single parent edits a record
  When the conflict detection service runs
  Then it does not identify a conflict

### AC 2: Automatic Resolution Strategies
**Simultaneous edits by multiple parents are identified automatically**

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testResolveWithLastWriteWins
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testMergeChangesWithNoConflicts
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testMergeChangesWithConflicts
- Integration Tests: CloudKitConflictHandlerTests.testHandleConflictsWithRecords

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given multiple parents make conflicting changes to a record
  When the last-write-wins strategy is applied
  Then the most recent change is selected as the resolution

- Given multiple parents make non-conflicting changes to a record
  When the merge strategy is applied
  Then all changes are combined into a single resolution

### AC 3: Manual Resolution UI
**User-friendly interface for manual conflict resolution**

**Test Coverage:**
- UI Tests: ConflictResolutionView preview functionality
- UI Tests: ConflictChangeView preview functionality
- UI Tests: ConflictNotificationView preview functionality

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given a conflict is detected
  When the parent opens the conflict resolution view
  Then they see a clear presentation of conflicting changes

- Given a parent is viewing conflicting changes
  When they select a resolution option
  Then they can apply their chosen resolution

### AC 4: Merge Capabilities
**Non-conflicting changes are automatically combined**

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testMergeChangesWithNoConflicts
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testMergeChangesWithConflicts

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given multiple parents change different fields of the same record
  When the merge strategy is applied
  Then all changes are combined without conflict

- Given multiple parents change the same field of a record
  When the merge strategy is applied
  Then the conflict is identified and manual resolution is required

### AC 5: Conflict Metadata & Auditing
**Conflict information is stored for audit purposes**

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: ConflictResolverTests.testStoreConflictMetadata
- Integration Tests: CloudKitConflictHandlerTests.testHandleConflictsWithRecords

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given a conflict is resolved
  When the resolution is completed
  Then metadata about the conflict and resolution is stored

- Given conflict metadata is stored
  When an administrator queries for audit information
  Then they can retrieve details about the conflict and how it was resolved

### AC 6: User Notifications
**Parents are alerted to conflicts requiring attention**

**Test Coverage:**
- UI Tests: ConflictNotificationView preview functionality

**Given-When-Then Scenarios:**
- Given a conflict is detected
  When the system processes the conflict
  Then a notification is sent to the parent

- Given a parent receives a conflict notification
  When they tap the notification
  Then they are taken to the conflict resolution interface

## Test Coverage Summary

| Acceptance Criteria | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | UI Tests | Coverage Status |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| AC 1: Conflict Detection | 4 | 1 | 0 | GOOD |
| AC 2: Automatic Resolution | 3 | 1 | 0 | GOOD |
| AC 3: Manual Resolution UI | 0 | 0 | 3 | GOOD |
| AC 4: Merge Capabilities | 2 | 0 | 0 | GOOD |
| AC 5: Conflict Metadata | 1 | 1 | 0 | GOOD |
| AC 6: User Notifications | 0 | 0 | 1 | MINIMAL |

## Coverage Gaps

1. **AC 3: Manual Resolution UI** - Needs more comprehensive UI tests for the complete workflow
2. **AC 6: User Notifications** - Needs more comprehensive tests for notification delivery and handling

## Recommendations

1. Add UI tests for the complete conflict resolution workflow from detection to resolution
2. Add integration tests for notification delivery and handling
3. Add performance tests for conflict resolution under load

## Overall Traceability Status: GOOD

All acceptance criteria are traceable to tests, with good coverage for most requirements. Some UI and integration test coverage could be enhanced.
