# NFR Assessment - Story 6.5: Conflict Resolution

## Assessment Date: 2025-09-30
## Assessed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Non-Functional Requirements Validation

### 1. Security
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:** 
- Conflict metadata is stored securely in CloudKit with appropriate access controls
- No sensitive data is exposed through the conflict resolution process
- Existing permission system is leveraged for access control
- Audit logging ensures traceability of all conflict resolution actions

### 2. Performance
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:**
- Conflict detection uses efficient algorithms with minimal overhead
- Resolution strategies are optimized for quick execution (target: <1 second for typical cases)
- CloudKit's built-in conflict detection capabilities are leveraged
- Memory-efficient data structures are used for conflict metadata

### 3. Reliability
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:**
- Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the conflict resolution process
- Multiple resolution strategies provide fallback options
- Proper async/await patterns ensure reliable execution
- Integration with CloudKit's conflict handling mechanisms provides additional reliability

### 4. Maintainability
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:**
- Code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Services are properly decoupled and testable
- Follows project coding standards and architectural patterns
- Clear documentation and comments explain the conflict resolution process

### 5. Usability
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:**
- Manual conflict resolution UI is intuitive and user-friendly
- Clear presentation of conflicting changes with side-by-side comparison
- Simple selection mechanism for preferred changes
- Appropriate notifications alert parents to conflicts requiring attention

### 6. Scalability
**Status:** PASS
**Notes:**
- Implementation can handle multiple simultaneous conflicts
- CloudKit infrastructure provides automatic scaling
- Conflict metadata storage is designed for efficient querying
- Resolution strategies are stateless and can be parallelized
