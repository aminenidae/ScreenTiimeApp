# Rollback Procedures for Story Implementations

## Purpose

This document outlines rollback procedures for each story implementation to ensure safe deployment and recovery in case of issues. These procedures are critical for a brownfield project where new features integrate with existing code.

## General Rollback Principles

1. **Version Control**: All changes must be committed to Git with clear, descriptive commit messages
2. **Backup Strategy**: Database snapshots and code backups should be created before major deployments
3. **Gradual Rollback**: Prefer granular rollbacks over complete system rollbacks when possible
4. **Testing**: All rollback procedures should be tested in a staging environment before production use
5. **Documentation**: Each rollback procedure should be documented with clear steps and success criteria

## Database Rollback Procedures

### CloudKit Schema Rollback
**Procedure:**

4. Use CloudKit Console to remove unused record types (if safe to do so)
5. Verify data integrity of existing records

### Data Migration Rollback
**Procedure:**
1. Identify data transformations performed
2. Create reverse transformation scripts
3. Backup current data state before rollback
4. Apply reverse transformations
5. Verify data integrity

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug Response
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Assess impact scope and severity
2. Determine if rollback is necessary
3. If rollback required:
   a. Notify team and stakeholders
   b. Execute appropriate rollback procedure
   c. Monitor system for issues
   d. Communicate status to users if affected

### Deployment Failure
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Halt deployment process
2. Identify failure point
3. Execute rollback to last known good state
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix issue before attempting redeployment

## Testing Rollback Procedures

### Pre-deployment Testing
1. Test rollback procedures in staging environment
2. Verify all steps are clear and executable
3. Confirm success criteria are measurable
4. Document any issues found during testing

### Post-deployment Validation
1. Verify rollback procedures remain valid after deployment
2. Update procedures if deployment changes affect rollback
3. Test critical rollback paths periodically

## Communication Plan

### During Rollback Execution
1. Notify development team immediately
2. Inform product owner and stakeholders
3. Provide regular status updates
4. Document rollback execution and results

### Post-Rollback Analysis
1. Conduct post-mortem analysis
2. Identify root cause of issue requiring rollback
3. Update procedures based on lessons learned
4. Share findings with team to prevent recurrence

## Maintenance

### Regular Review
1. Review rollback procedures quarterly
2. Update procedures when system architecture changes
3. Test critical rollback paths annually
4. Incorporate feedback from actual rollback events

### Version Control
1. Maintain rollback procedures in version control
2. Update procedures with each significant deployment
3. Tag procedure versions to match system versions
4. Archive obsolete procedures for historical reference
