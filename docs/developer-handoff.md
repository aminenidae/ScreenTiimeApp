# Developer Handoff Document

**Project:** Reward-Based Screen Time Management App
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT
**Start Date:** Ready to begin
**Product Owner:** Sarah

---

## Quick Start

### What Changed
1. ‚úÖ **Multi-parent features deferred to v1.1** (3 weeks saved)
2. ‚úÖ **Epic 1-3 stories corrected** (infrastructure setup fixed)
3. ‚úÖ **iOS version updated** to 15.0+ (Family Controls requirement)
4. ‚úÖ **Epic 6 added** for v1.1 (multi-parent collaboration)

### What to Build First

**Week 1-2: Epic 1 - Foundation**
```
Story 1.1: SPM package structure + Xcode project
Story 1.2: Family Controls integration
Story 1.3: CloudKit schema + repository protocols
Story 1.4: iCloud authentication (single-parent)
```

**Start Here:** Story 1.1 - Project scaffolding

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Package Structure (Story 1.1)
**Added to acceptance criteria:**
- Create `Packages/SharedModels/` - Data models and enums
- Create `Packages/DesignSystem/` - UI components
- Create `Packages/RewardCore/` - Business logic
- Create `Packages/CloudKitService/` - CloudKit wrapper
- Create `Packages/FamilyControlsKit/` - Family Controls wrapper

**Action:** Create these packages BEFORE implementing features

---

### Fix #2: CloudKit Schema (Story 1.3)
**Added to acceptance criteria:**
- Deploy CloudKit schema with 7 record types
- Create custom zones (per-child private zones)
- Define repository protocols (Family, Child, etc.)
- Implement CoreData local cache
- Create mock repositories for testing

**Action:** Deploy CloudKit schema in Story 1.3, BEFORE Story 1.4

---

### Fix #3: Repository Protocols (Story 1.3)
**Added to acceptance criteria:**
- `FamilyRepository` protocol
- `ChildProfileRepository` protocol
- `AppCategorizationRepository` protocol
- `UsageSessionRepository` protocol
- `PointTransactionRepository` protocol

**Action:** Define protocols in Story 1.3, implement in subsequent stories

---

### Fix #4: Multi-Parent Deferred (v1.1)
**Removed from v1.0:**
- Multi-parent authentication (Story 1.4)
- Co-parent dashboard visibility (Story 3.1)
- Entire Story 3.5 (invite/manage parents)

**Prepare for v1.1:**
- Include `Family.sharedWithUserIDs` field (empty in v1.0)
- Include `metadata.modifiedBy` in all models
- Build single-parent UI that can expand later

**Action:** Build single-parent functionality, keep data model multi-parent ready

## Key Architecture Decisions

### CloudKit Zone Strategy
```
- Default Zone: Family, FamilySettings
- Custom Zone per Child: "child-{UUID}"
  - ChildProfile
  - AppCategorization
  - UsageSession
  - PointTransaction
  - RewardRedemption
```

### Repository Pattern
```swift
// Define protocols in Story 1.3
protocol FamilyRepository {
    func createFamily(_ family: Family) -> AnyPublisher<Family, Error>
    func fetchFamily(id: UUID) -> AnyPublisher<Family, Error>
    // ...
}

// Implement in CloudKitService
class CloudKitFamilyRepository: FamilyRepository {
    // Implementation
}

// Use in ViewModels
class DashboardViewModel {
    private let familyRepo: FamilyRepository
}
```

### Data Model Preparation for v1.1
```swift
struct Family {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let ownerUserID: String
    var sharedWithUserIDs: [String] = [] // Empty in v1.0, populated in v1.1
    // ...
}

// All models include:
struct Metadata {
    let modifiedBy: String // Track which parent made changes
    let modifiedAt: Date
}
```

---

## Testing Requirements

### Story 1.1
- ‚úÖ Project compiles
- ‚úÖ All packages load correctly
- ‚úÖ Navigation structure works

### Story 1.2
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires physical device** (Family Controls not in Simulator)
- ‚úÖ Authorization request appears
- ‚úÖ Parent/child role detection works

### Story 1.3
- ‚úÖ CloudKit schema deployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Repository protocols compile
- ‚úÖ Mock repositories pass unit tests
- ‚úÖ CoreData cache saves/retrieves

### Story 1.4
- ‚úÖ iCloud account status detected
- ‚úÖ Family creation works
- ‚úÖ Single parent can authenticate
- ‚úÖ Data isolation verified

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
1. ‚ùå Start coding before creating packages (Story 1.1)
2. ‚ùå Use Screen Time API instead of Family Controls
3. ‚ùå Deploy CloudKit schema manually (use Xcode)
4. ‚ùå Implement features before repository protocols exist
5. ‚ùå Add multi-parent features to v1.0 (deferred to v1.1)
6. ‚ùå Test Family Controls on Simulator (won't work)

### ‚úÖ Do This
1. ‚úÖ Create all SPM packages in Story 1.1
2. ‚úÖ Use Family Controls framework (iOS 15.0+)
3. ‚úÖ Deploy CloudKit schema via Xcode in Story 1.3
4. ‚úÖ Define repository protocols before implementations
5. ‚úÖ Build single-parent UI, prepare data model for v1.1
6. ‚úÖ Test Family Controls on physical device

---

## v1.1 Preparation

### What to Include Now (for v1.1 compatibility)
```swift
// Family model
struct Family {
    var sharedWithUserIDs: [String] = [] // ‚Üê Include this
}

// All models
struct AppCategorization {
    let createdBy: String // ‚Üê Include this
    let modifiedBy: String // ‚Üê Include this
}
```

### What NOT to Implement Now
- ‚ùå Parent invitation flow
- ‚ùå Real-time sync infrastructure
- ‚ùå Activity log UI
- ‚ùå Conflict resolution
- ‚ùå Multi-parent permissions

**These are Epic 6 (v1.1), starting Week 14**

## FAQ

**Q: Why iOS 15.0 minimum instead of 14.0?**
A: Family Controls framework requires iOS 15.0+. Covers 95%+ of market.

**Q: Why defer multi-parent features?**
A: Reduces MVP complexity 35%, saves 3 weeks, eliminates high-risk CloudKit sync bugs. v1.1 delivers full feature set.

**Q: What's the difference between Family Controls and Screen Time API?**
A: Family Controls is modern (iOS 15+), robust, and recommended. Screen Time API is deprecated and less reliable.

**Q: Can I use Firebase instead of CloudKit?**
A: No. Architecture specifies CloudKit for serverless, iCloud integration, and zero backend maintenance.

**Q: Should I test on Simulator or device?**
A: Physical device required for Family Controls. Simulator OK for UI-only work.

**Q: What if I find a blocking issue?**
A: Halt development, document issue, tag Product Owner (Sarah) immediately.
