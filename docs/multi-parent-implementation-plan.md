# Multi-Parent Collaboration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for multi-parent collaboration features (Epic 6) which were deferred from the MVP to reduce complexity. These features will be implemented in v1.1 after the core reward system is stable and validated.

## Current Status

### Architectural Readiness
The v1.0 implementation has prepared the foundation for multi-parent features:
- `Family.sharedWithUserIDs` array field supports multi-parent data model
- `metadata.modifiedBy` tracking in all records
- CloudKit shared zone architecture
- iCloud Family Sharing integration
- Repository pattern with protocol abstractions

### Deferred Features
The following features are planned for v1.1 implementation:
- Parent invitation system
- Real-time synchronization
- Activity log and co-parent visibility
- Permissions and access control
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Implementation Approach
