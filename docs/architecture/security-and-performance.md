# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**iOS Security:**
- Data Protection: `.completeFileProtection`
- Keychain: Sensitive tokens

**Family Controls Security:**
- Parent authorization via Face ID/Touch ID
- System-level enforcement (tamper-proof)

**COPPA Compliance:**
- Age verification via parent-created accounts
- Parental consent through iCloud Family Sharing
- Data minimization (no behavioral tracking)

## Performance Optimization

**Targets:**
- App launch: <2 seconds
- Memory: <100MB typical
- Battery: <5% daily drain
- Storage: <100MB installed
- Subscription validation: <1 second latency
- Payment processing: >95% success rate

**Strategies:**
- Indexed CloudKit queries
- CoreData cache (70% reduction in CloudKit calls)
- Lazy loading with `LazyVStack`
- 60fps animations
