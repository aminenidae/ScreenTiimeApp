## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risks:**
1. iOS 15.0+ requirement (5% market exclusion)
2. CloudKit vendor lock-in
3. Receipt validation complexity (mitigated with CloudKit Functions)

**Low Risks:**
4. Background task reliability
5. Family Controls complexity
6. Widget data sharing setup
7. StoreKit 2 learning curve (well-documented by Apple)
8. App Store subscription review process

## Recommendations

**Must-Fix:** None - Architecture is development-ready ✅

**Should-Fix:**
1. ~~Update PRD to align with iOS 15.0 baseline~~ ✅ Completed (PRD v1.2)
2. Document theoretical CloudKit migration path

**Nice-to-Have:**
1. Add Lottie animations for gamification
2. Document non-iCloud user fallback
3. Include performance benchmarks

## Epic 7 Integration Summary

**Monetization Strategy (PRD v1.2):**

The architecture now includes comprehensive StoreKit 2 subscription infrastructure added in PRD v1.2:

**Subscription Tiers:**
- 1 Child Plan: $9.99/month or $89.99/year
- 2 Child Plan: $13.98/month or $125.99/year
- 3+ Child Plan: +$3.99/month or +$25/year per additional child
- 14-day free trial (no payment method required)

**New Architecture Components:**
1. **SubscriptionService Package** - StoreKit 2 integration, product fetching, purchase handling
2. **FeatureGateService** - Subscription-based feature access control
3. **CloudKit Function: validateSubscriptionReceipt** - Server-side receipt validation
4. **SubscriptionEntitlement Data Model** - Tracks active subscriptions and entitlements
5. **PaywallView & Subscription Management UI** - Conversion-optimized purchase flows

**Technical Implementation:**
- StoreKit 2 async/await API for modern subscription handling
- CloudKit Functions for fraud-resistant receipt validation
- Offline grace period support (7 days) for network issues
- Feature gating enforces tier-based access limits
- Background task for hourly subscription validation
- Apple Family Sharing compatibility

**Success Metrics:**
- Trial-to-paid conversion >30%
- Monthly churn rate <5%
- Average LTV >$150 per family
- Payment failure rate <2%
- Receipt validation latency <1 second

**App Store Compliance:**
- Guideline 3.1 (In-App Purchase) fully addressed
- Clear pricing and terms before purchase
- Subscription management via iOS Settings
- Restore purchases functionality
- Privacy policy updated for payment data handling
