# Project Brief: Reward-Based Screen Time Management App

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop an innovative iOS app that transforms traditional screen time management from a restrictive model to a reward-based system. The app allows children to earn points for time spent on educational apps, which can then be converted into screen time for recreational apps or real-world rewards. This approach addresses the core pain points of both children (feeling punished) and parents (managing screen time conflicts) by creating positive behavioral reinforcement rather than negative restrictions.

## Problem Statement

Current screen time management solutions, particularly Apple's built-in Screen Time feature, create adversarial relationships between parents and children by focusing purely on restrictions. Key issues include:

- Children feel punished rather than motivated to engage in educational activities
- Parents face constant negotiation and conflict around screen time limits
- Traditional approaches don't encourage positive digital habits
- Limited customization options for different family needs and values
- No integration with real-world reward systems or educational goals

Market research indicates that 73% of parents struggle with screen time management, and 68% report it as a source of family conflict. Existing solutions fail to address the root cause: the negative framing of screen time management.

## Proposed Solution

Our app introduces a revolutionary reward-based screen time management system that:

1. Allows parents to categorize apps as "learning" or "reward"
2. Enables children to earn points for time spent on educational apps
3. Lets children convert points to screen time for recreational apps or real-world rewards
4. Provides subject-specific point values to prioritize learning areas
5. Integrates with existing family reward systems (chore charts, allowance apps)
6. Features adaptive difficulty to maintain engagement as children progress

This solution differentiates itself from Apple's Screen Time by reframing screen time from a punishment to an earned privilege, creating positive behavioral reinforcement while maintaining necessary parental controls.
